Initial reports from the Horn of Africa have indicated the young man is anywhere from 16 to 19 years old.

The USS Nassau had come to the aid of an Indian ship on which pirates were holding 16 Indian hostages.

Having newly discovered the sport myself, it occurred to me as I watched Marine One lift off the South Lawn on Friday that there are probably some lessons on the river that could apply to Obama's presidency.\n\n\n\nThinking like a producer, I called an expert -- fly-fishing instructor Tony Derosier, who described the evolution most fishermen go through.\n\n\n\n\"Usually, when you first go fishing, all you want to do is catch a fish, and then all you want to do is catch a lot of fish, and then you just want to catch the larger fish. After you've caught a lot of large fish, you kind of go back to square one and catch just one fish,\" said Derosier, manager at Taylor Creek Fly Shop in Aspen, Colorado. \"You basically just want to go fishing -- the numbers, the size, it doesn't matter any more.\"\n\n\n\nObama is in the \"big fish\" stage of his presidency: He's trying to get health-care reform legislation passed hook, line, and sinker. If he's successful, anything else he gets passed will be icing on the cake.\n\n\n\nLearning the fundamentals of fly-fishing can serve as a metaphor for health care reform. Obama just needs to look at hooking and landing Blue Dog Democrats and Republicans like he would trout.\n\n\n\nThe first step -- learn how to cast. \"Fly-casting is all about maximizing the energy you put in your rod and you lose energy if you wait too long,\" Derosier said. \"And conversely, if you don't wait long enough, your line will crack like a whip.\" Obama has to strike the right balance between rushing things through and losing momentum; and maintaining support while bringing others over to his side.\n\n\n\nThe second step -- reading the water: \"Instead of blindly casting anywhere in the river you want to understand where you might find fish,\" Derosier explained. Obama zeroed in on a fairly conservative state, Montana, where he faces a land full of skeptics about his health care reform plan.\n\n\n\nThird -- hook and land the fish: Derosier said once you hook the fish you have to know how to play the fish, which is a delicate balance between applying pressure but not so much that the line breaks -- much like the delicate balance of Obama's courting members of Congress.\n\n\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to gain an advantage over the fish so that you can land him,\" he said. \"It's the hardest thing to teach when it comes to fly-fishing,\" he said.\n\n\n\nOut in Montana, the game is catch-and-release trout.

Other scams include confidence frauds such as Ponzi schemes, check fraud, the Nigerian letter fraud and identity fraud.\n\n\n\nOne popular identity fraud scam used during 2008 involved sending e-mails crafted to appear as if they'd been sent by the FBI. Sometimes the scammers went so far as to say the mailings were from FBI Director Robert Mueller himself, according to the center.\n\n\n\nThe e-mails would ask the recipient for personal information, such as a bank account numbers, claiming the FBI wanted the information to look into an impending financial transaction. One variation of the scheme, according to the center, was to send an e-mail saying the recipient is entitled to lottery money or an inheritance and the funds can be moved as soon as bank account information is supplied.\n\n\n\nThe FBI has issued warnings about such scams in the past, and Monday's report included a new one: \"The FBI does not contact U.S. citizens regarding personal financial matters through unsolicited e-mails.\"\n\n\n\nThe report said that about 77.4 percent of perpetrators of Internet fraud were men, and about half lived in either California, New York, Florida, Washington, Texas or the District of Columbia.

In 1789 and again in 1790, Congress imposed alcohol tariffs to pay Revolutionary War debts. In response to the tax on imports, Americans began distilling their own spirits. And when the federal government began taxing those beverages, citizens staged the \"Whiskey Rebellion,\" harassing and threatening federal agents in several cities.\n\n\n\nBut in 1794, the government squelched the uprising, helping to establish the federal government's authority in disputes with individual states.\n\n\n\nEven non-historians might appreciate the timelessness of the dog-eared document, given its skillful use of bureaucratic language to deliver bad news. One eye-glazing, 76-word sentence probably can be summarized as follows: \"We don't have the thermometers you'll need, so for now, use the ones you've got.\"\n\n\n\nThe document, dated Dec. 18, 1790, is an original draft of a \"circular letter,\" an official memo that would have been hand-copied and sent to customs officers, historians said.\n\n\n\n\"In this circular letter, Hamilton attempts to provide customs officers with new tools to more efficiently do their jobs,\" said Kenneth Melson, acting director of ATF. Hamilton notes that he is sending a hydrometer -- used to determine the specific gravity or density of liquids -- to ports so that customs officers can determine the proof of imported beverages.\n\n\n\nHamilton says he intends to provide two hydrometers to every port; one to be used as a standard or check. \"But it is not possible in the first instance to send both. Hence one only will accompany this letter,\" he writes.\n\n\n\nIn a postscript, he adds that he is also sending a \"Tin Cylinder\" to hold liquor while its alcohol content is being measured.\n\n\n\nArchivists said the early history of the Hamilton circular is not known. But in the mid-1970s, an ATF spokesman and autograph collector -- Howard Criswell Jr. -- came across the letter in a catalog from an autograph dealer in New York City. He purchased it for about $100, intending to use it in an ATF bicentennial exhibit. Criswell, now 84, is retired and lives in Maryland.\n\n\n\nThe document remained in an ATF safe until it was rediscovered by ATF employees during a relocation of its headquarters building in 2005.\n\n\n\nATF officials said they had once planned to frame the letter, but were told that it would be damaged by exposure to light.\n\n\n\nThe National Archives said the document will become part of its permanent holdings and will be preserved in a locked, temperature and humidity-controlled stack area at its facility in College Park, Maryland.", "question": "What is the date of the document that chronicles the federal government's earliest efforts to regulate alcohol?", "answer": "December 18, 1790.", "correct_answers": ["Dec. 18, 1790,"]}]
