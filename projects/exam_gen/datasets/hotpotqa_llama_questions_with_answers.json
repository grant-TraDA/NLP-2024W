An accidental American is a citizen of a country other than the United States who may also be considered a U.S. citizen under U.S. nationality law but is not aware of having U.S. status, or has only become aware of it recently during adulthood.  Accidental Americans' U.S. citizenship arises due to their parents' ties to the United States rather than their own choices: they may be born in their own country but to one U.S. citizen parent who emigrated from the United States, or they may be born in the U.S. to parents residing in the country temporarily for work or study and then return to their own country in their early childhood, with few if any memories of the United States.  The term may also sometimes be applied to people who definitely are not U.S. citizens but have some other sort of connection with the country, for example green card holders who moved back to their country of origin and let their green cards expire without formally cancelling their U.S. immigration status, or non-U.S. citizens married to Americans abroad.  Such tenuous connections to the United States began to become a more salient issue in the late 2000s due to Internal Revenue Service crackdowns which were ostensibly aimed at tax evaders hiding assets in secrecy jurisdictions but ended up having much broader effects on people with U.S. citizenship who resided in other countries, as well as their families.

Within the TN set of occupations, a United States, Canadian, or Mexican citizen can work in the one of the other two countries for up to three years, but does not have the right to apply for permanent residence.  The permit may be renewed indefinitely.

In 2000, Greengard, Arvid Carlsson and Eric Kandel were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning signal transduction in the nervous system.  He is currently Vincent Astor Professor at Rockefeller University, and serves on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Cure Alzheimer's Fund, as well as the Scientific Council of the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation.  He is married to artist Ursula von Rydingsvard. Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature (Swedish: \"Nobelpriset i litteratur\" ) has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\" (original Swedish: \"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framst\u00e5ende verket i en idealisk riktning\").  Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"work\" refers to an author's work as a whole.  The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year.  The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Eric Richard Kandel (] ; born November 7, 1929) is an Austrian-American neuroscientist and a University Professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.  He was a recipient of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the physiological basis of memory storage in neurons.  He shared the prize with Arvid Carlsson and Paul Greengard. Arvid Carlsson (born 25 January 1923) is a Swedish neuropharmacologist who is best known for his work with the neurotransmitter dopamine and its effects in Parkinson's disease.  For his work on dopamine, Carlsson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000, along with co-recipients Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard. First published in 1981 by Elsevier, Principles of Neural Science is an influential neuroscience textbook edited by Eric R. Kandel, James H. Schwartz, and Thomas M. Jessell.

Two of his mentors (ERK and PG) received in 2000 the Nobel Prize for their contributions to medicine.  After working at the INSERM in Paris (1990-1995) and at the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla (1995-1998) with Nobel Prize winner Gerald Edelman, he joined the University of California Irvine School of Medicine, where he is now Louise Turner Arnold Chair in Neurosciences and Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Pharmacology and Biological Chemistry.  He is also founding director of the department of Drug Discovery and Development (D3) at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Genova, Italy. The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science is a book on neuroplasticity by psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Norman Doidge, M.D.  It features numerous case studies of patients suffering from neurological disorders and details how in each case the brain adapts to compensate for the disabilities of the individual patients, often in unusual and unexpected ways.  Interviews with the patients, clinicians, and research scientists involved in these studies make up a large portion of the contents.  Doidge uses examples of previous work carried out by neuroscientists such as Paul Broca, Sigmund Freud, Alexander Luria, Donald O. Hebb, Paul Bach-y-Rita, and Eric Kandel to show that the brain is adaptive, and thus plastic.  Through the case studies, Doidge demonstrates both the beneficial and detrimental effects that neuroplasticity can have on a patient, saying, \"...\u00a0neuroplasticity contributes to both the constrained and unconstrained aspects of our nature.\"  However, according to Doige, neuroplasticity \"...\u00a0renders our brains not only more resourceful, but also more vulnerable to outside influences.\"", "question": "What kind of cells do Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard share a Nobel Prize for their research of?", "answer": "Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000 for their discoveries concerning signal transduction in neurons.", "correct_answers": ["neurons"]}, {"context": "Symphyotrichum chilense (formerly \"Aster chilensis\") is a species of aster known by the common names Pacific aster and common California aster. Symphyotrichum ericoides, syn.  \"Aster ericoides\" (common name white heath aster, white aster or heath aster), is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to much of North America, as well as northern Mexico.  It has also been introduced to many areas beyond its native range. Laelia is a small genus of 25 species in the orchid family (Orchidaceae).  \"Laelia\" species are found in areas of subtropical or temperate climate in Central and South America, but mostly in Mexico.  \"Laelia\" is abbreviated L. in the horticultural trade. Aster yellows is a chronic, systemic plant disease caused by a bacterium-like organism called a phytoplasma.  The aster yellows phytoplasma (AYP) affects 300 species in 38 families of broad-leaf herbaceous plants, primarily in the aster family, as well as important cereal crops such as wheat and barley.  Symptoms are variable and can include phyllody, virescence, chlorosis, stunting, and sterility of flowers.  The aster leafhopper vector, \"Macrosteles quadrilineatus\", moves the aster yellows phytoplasma from plant to plant.  Its economic burden is primarily felt in the carrot (\"Daucus carota\" ssp.\"  sativus\") crop industry, as well as the nursery industry.  No cure is known for plants infected with aster yellows.  Infected plants should be removed immediately to limit the continued spread of the phytoplasma to other susceptible plants.  However, in agricultural settings such as carrot fields, some application of chemical insecticides has proven to minimize the rate of infection by killing the vector. Eurybia macrophylla, commonly known as the bigleaf aster, large-leaved aster, largeleaf aster or bigleaf wood aster, is an herbaceous perennial in the composite family that was formerly treated in the genus \"Aster\".  It is native to eastern North America, with a range extending from eastern and central Canada (from Nova Scotia to Manitoba) through the northeastern deciduous and mixed forests of New England and the Great Lakes region and south along the Appalachians as far as the northeastern corner of Georgia, and west as far as Minnesota, Missouri and Arkansas.  The flowers appear in the late summer to early fall and show ray florets that are usually either a deep lavender or violet, but sometimes white, and disc florets that are cream-coloured or light yellow, becoming purple as they mature.  It is one of the parent species of the hybrid \"Eurybia \u00d7 herveyi\". Aster is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae.  Its circumscription has been narrowed, and it now encompasses around 180 species, all but one of which are restricted to Eurasia; many species formerly in \"Aster\" are now in other genera of the tribe Astereae. Laelia marginata is a species of orchid in genus \"Laelia\".  \"L. marginata\" is found in Suriname. Symphyotrichum lanceolatum (syn.  \"Aster lanceolatus\") is a species of flowering plant in the aster family, Asteraceae.  It is native to Canada and the United States.  Common names include panicled aster, tall white aster, eastern line aster, lance-leaf aster, narrow-leaf Michaelmas daisy, and white-panicle aster. Symphyotrichum ascendens (formerly \"Aster ascendens\") is a species of aster known by the common names western aster and long-leaved aster.  It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Saskatchewan, the Sierra Nevada in California, to Arizona and New Mexico.  It grows in many types of habitat, including disturbed areas. Symphyotrichum ( ) is a genus of about 90 species of herbaceous annual and perennial plants in the composite family (Asteraceae) that were formerly treated within the genus \"Aster\".  The majority are endemic to North America, but several species also occur in the West Indies, Central and South America, as well as in eastern Eurasia.  Many species have been introduced to Europe as garden specimens, most notably the New England aster (\"Symphyotrichum novae-angliae\") and the New York aster (\"Symphyotrichum novi-belgii\").", "question": "Does Laelia or Aster have more species?", "answer": "Laelia has 25 species, while Aster (now known as Symphyotrichum) has around 180 species. So, Aster has significantly more species than Laelia.", "correct_answers": ["Aster"]}, {"context": "A roughing pump is any vacuum pump (typically mechanical) used to initially evacuate a vacuum system, as a first stage towards achieving high vacuum or ultra high vacuum.  The term \"roughing pump\" derives from the vacuum range it works in, \"rough vacuum\", above 1x10\u00a0torr (0.1 Pa).  Pumps that operate in the high vacuum ranges typically don't operate, or only operate inefficiently, at atmospheric pressures, whereas pumps that work efficiently at atmospheric pressure usually cannot produce a vacuum lower than approximately 1x10\u00a0torr. The Schlenk line (also vacuum gas manifold) is a commonly used chemistry apparatus developed by Wilhelm Schlenk.  It consists of a dual manifold with several ports.  One manifold is connected to a source of purified inert gas, while the other is connected to a vacuum pump.  The inert-gas line is vented through an oil bubbler, while solvent vapors and gaseous reaction products are prevented from contaminating the vacuum pump by a liquid-nitrogen or dry-ice/acetone cold trap.  Special stopcocks or Teflon taps allow vacuum or inert gas to be selected without the need for placing the sample on a separate line. A Holweck pump is a type of vacuum pump that utilises the drag of air molecules against a rotating surface.  The modern turbomolecular pump is a more advanced version based on similar operation, and a Holweck pump is often used as the backing pump for it.  The Holweck pump can produce a vacuum as low as 1e-8 mmHg . The Magdeburg hemispheres are a pair of large copper hemispheres, with mating rims.  They were used to demonstrate the power of atmospheric pressure.  When the rims were sealed with grease and the air was pumped out, the sphere contained a vacuum and could not be pulled apart by teams of horses.  The Magdeburg hemispheres were designed by a German scientist and mayor of Magdeburg, Otto von Guericke, to demonstrate the air pump that he had invented, and the concept of atmospheric pressure.  The first artificial vacuum had been produced a few years earlier by Evangelista Torricelli, and had inspired Guericke to design the world's first vacuum pump, which consisted of a piston and cylinder with one-way flap valves.  The hemispheres became popular in physics lectures as an illustration of the strength of air pressure, and are still used in education.  A pair of the original hemispheres are preserved in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Otto von Guericke (originally spelled \"Gericke\", ] ; November 20, 1602 \u2013 May 11, 1686 (Julian calendar); November 30, 1602 \u2013 May 21, 1686 (Gregorian calendar)) was a German scientist, inventor, and politician.  His major scientific achievements were the establishment of the physics of vacuums, the discovery of an experimental method for clearly demonstrating electrostatic repulsion, and his advocacy of the reality of \"action at a distance\" and of \"absolute space\". A vacuum pump is a device that removes gas molecules from a sealed volume in order to leave behind a partial vacuum.  The first vacuum pump was invented in 1650 by Otto von Guericke, and was preceded by the suction pump, which dates to antiquity. The sorption pump is a vacuum pump that creates a vacuum by adsorbing molecules on a very porous material like molecular sieve which is cooled by a cryogen, typically liquid nitrogen.  The ultimate pressure is about 10 mbar.  With special techniques this can be lowered till 10 mbar.  The main advantages are the absence of oil or other contaminants, low cost and vibration free operation because there are no moving parts.  The main disadvantages are that it cannot operate continuously and cannot effectively pump hydrogen, helium and neon, all gases with lower condensation temperature than liquid nitrogen.  The main application is as a roughing pump for a sputter-ion pump in ultra-high vacuum experiments, for example in surface physics. A scroll compressor (also called \"spiral compressor\", scroll pump and scroll vacuum pump) is a device for compressing air or refrigerant.  It is used in air conditioning equipment, as an automobile supercharger (where it is known as a scroll-type supercharger) and as a vacuum pump.  Many residential central heat pump and air conditioning systems and a few automotive air conditioning systems employ a scroll compressor instead of the more traditional rotary, reciprocating, and wobble-plate compressors. A vacuum chamber is a rigid enclosure from which air and other gases are removed by a vacuum pump.  This results in a low-pressure environment within the chamber, commonly referred to as a vacuum.  A vacuum environment allows researchers to conduct physical experiments or to test mechanical devices which must operate in outer space (for example) or for processes such as vacuum drying or vacuum coating.  Chambers are typically made of metals which may or may not shield applied external magnetic fields depending on wall thickness, frequency, resistivity, and permeability of the material used.  Only some materials are suitable for vacuum use. A turbomolecular pump is a type of vacuum pump, superficially similar to a turbopump, used to obtain and maintain high vacuum.  These pumps work on the principle that gas molecules can be given momentum in a desired direction by repeated collision with a moving solid surface.  In a turbomolecular pump, a rapidly spinning fan rotor 'hits' gas molecules from the inlet of the pump towards the exhaust in order to create or maintain a vacuum.", "question": "What nationality was the inventor of the first vacuum pump?", "answer": "German.", "correct_answers": ["German"]}, {"context": "]A 2001 Nissan Altima, 1N4DL01D81C212547 is the VIN of a blue rental car belonging to Alamo Rent a Car, that was found in the Portland International Jetport parking lot, following the September 11, 2001 attacks.

The Football League Super Cup (later known under its sponsored name as the ScreenSport Super Cup) was a one-off football club competition held in England in the 1985\u201386 season.  It was organised by the Football League and was intended as some form of financial and sporting compensation for the English clubs which had qualified for European competition in the previous season but had been banned from entering European tournaments by UEFA following the Heysel Stadium disaster.  With the ban set to last into the foreseeable future, England's clubs stood to lose a great deal of revenue, and would also have fewer opportunities to win silverware, so the Super Cup was established in order to hopefully offset at least some of this lost income, as well as offering additional competition for them.

Two skin heads are attached to a single hollow, often intricately carved wooden shell.  The preferred wood is jackwood, although other wood may be used.  Both left and right heads are usually made from cow hide that is stretched around a thin metal ring (sometimes lizard skin is used for the right head).  The outer circumference of each head is perforated with approximately seven to eight holes.  The two heads are held in tension by a continuous rope that is woven around the drum in a V-shape pattern.  Additional small coils of string or metal are tied around each pair of ropes near the left head.  These coils can be slide horizontally along the length of the drum, increasing or decreasing the tension between the heads as necessary.

William MacQuitty went on to direct the \"Titanic\" film \"A Night to Remember\". Ian Fleming, the writer who created the fictional character James Bond, lived to see the success of his novels depicted on screen before he died.  All fourteen books in the series created by Fleming went on to be huge successes on screen.  Goldfinger, one of the most epic stories in the James Bond saga, became a fan favorite with Shirley Bassey singing the iconic song, Goldfinger, that was played for the fiftieth anniversary of the Bond series at the Oscars in 2012.  Bond was played by Sean Connery and George Lazenby in the movies shot throughout the 60s.  The Bond movies were filmed all across the world and by different directors each time, with some of the old directors collaborating with the new ones.  The success of each Bond film lead to bigger budget prices for the following films adapted to the big screen.  Each movie recovered its budget and won critically acclaimed awards the years that they came out.  Of all the Bond films in cinema today, Thunderball is the most successful movie with the whole Bond series being the third highest grossing of all time in Hollywood cinema. Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine is a 1965 American International Pictures comedy film, made in Path\u00e9color, directed by Norman Taurog.  It stars Vincent Price, Frankie Avalon, Dwayne Hickman, Susan Hart and Jack Mullaney, and features Fred Clark.  It's a parody of the then-popular spy movie trend (the title is a spoof of two James Bond movies: the 1961 film \"Dr. No\" and the 1964 hit \"Goldfinger\"), made using actors from AIP's beach party and Edgar Allan Poe films. Semi-Tough is a 1977 American comedy film directed by Michael Ritchie and starring Burt Reynolds, Kris Kristofferson, Jill Clayburgh, Robert Preston, Lotte Lenya and Bert Convy.  It is set in the world of American professional football. Kulbhushan Kharbanda is an Indian actor, who works in Hindi and Punjabi films.  He is best known for his role as the antagonist Shakaal in \"Shaan\" (1980), inspired by the character Blofeld from James Bond movies.  Starting off with the Delhi-based theatre group \"Yatrik\" in the 1960s, he then moved to films with Sai Paranjpye's \"Jadu Ka Shankh\" in 1974.  He worked in several parallel cinema films before working in the mainstream Hindi film industry.  He later appeared in Mahesh Bhatt's classic \"Arth\" (1982), \"Ek Chadar Maili Si\" (1986), and in all three parts of Deepa Mehta's Elements trilogy; \"Fire\" (1996), \"Earth\" (1998), and \"Water\" (2005). Lotte Lenya (18 October 1898 \u2013 27 November 1981) was an Austrian singer, diseuse, and actress, long based in the United States.  In the German-speaking and classical music world she is best remembered for her performances of the songs of her husband, Kurt Weill.  In English-language cinema, she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as a jaded aristocrat in \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\" (1961).  She also played the murderous and sadistic Rosa Klebb in the James Bond movie \"From Russia with Love\" (1963). Bede Aircraft Corporation was founded by controversial aeronautical engineer Jim Bede in 1961 to produce the BD-1 kit aircraft, which eventually became the American Aviation Corporation's AA-1.  The company also created and produced a number of advanced kit planes including the famous Bede BD-5 (pusher propeller driven) and BD-5J (turbojet driven).  The BD-5J has held the Guinness record as the World's Smallest Jet Aircraft for more than a quarter century.  Versions of it saw use in various Budweiser commercials (the Bud Light Jet, which was lost in an inflight fire and crash unrelated to airshow work).

Originally intended as a military transport near the end of World War II, it was reworked after the war to compete with the Lockheed Constellation in the long-range commercial transport market.  More than 700 were built and many still fly today in cargo, military, and wildfire control roles. The Boeing KC-46 Pegasus is a military aerial refueling and strategic military transport aircraft developed by Boeing from its 767 jet airliner.  In February 2011, the tanker was selected by the United States Air Force (USAF) as the winner in the KC-X tanker competition to replace older KC-135 Stratotankers.  The first 18 combat-ready aircraft are scheduled to be delivered to the U.S. Air Force in early 2018 under the terms of the development contract. The Airbus A400M Atlas is a multi-national, four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft.  It was designed by Airbus Military (now Airbus Defence and Space) as a tactical airlifter with strategic capabilities to replace older transport aircraft, such as the Transall C-160 and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules.  The A400M is positioned, in terms of size, between the C-130 and the C-17; it can carry heavier loads than the C-130, while able to use rough landing strips.  Along with the transport role, the A400M can perform aerial refuelling and medical evacuation when fitted with appropriate equipment. The Hawker Siddeley HS 780 Andover is a twin-engined turboprop military transport aircraft produced by Hawker Siddeley for the Royal Air Force developed from the Avro-designed HS 748 airliner.  The Andover was named after the Avro Andover, a Royal Air Force (RAF) biplane transport used for medical evacuation between the first and second world wars; and RAF Andover, where trials of the aircraft were partially carried out.  The Andover had a kneeling landing gear to make ramp loading easier. Military transport aircraft or military cargo aircraft are typically fixed wing and rotary wing cargo aircraft which are used to airlift troops, weapons and other military equipment by a variety of methods to any area of military operations around the surface of the planet, usually outside the commercial flight routes in uncontrolled airspace.  Originally derived from bombers, military transport aircraft were used for delivering airborne forces during the Second World War and towing military gliders.  Some military transport aircraft are tasked to perform multi-role duties such as aerial refueling and, rescue missions, tactical, operational and strategic airlifts onto unprepared runways, or those constructed by engineers. The Messerschmitt Me 323 \"Gigant\" (\"Giant\") was a German military transport aircraft of World War II.  It was a powered variant of the Me 321 military glider and was the largest land-based transport aircraft of the war.  A total of 213 are recorded as having been made, a few being converted from the Me 321. The Douglas C-47 Skytrain or Dakota (RAF designation) is a military transport aircraft developed from the civilian Douglas DC-3 airliner.  It was used extensively by the Allies during World War II and remains in front line service with various military operators. The CASA/IPTN CN-235 is a medium-range twin-engined transport aircraft that was jointly developed by Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA (CASA) of Spain and Indonesian manufacturer IPTN, as a regional airliner and military transport.  Its primary military roles include maritime patrol, surveillance, and air transport.  Its largest user is Turkey which has 59 aircraft. The Antonov An-70 is a four-engine medium-range transport aircraft, and the first large aircraft to be powered by propfan engines.  It was developed in the late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft.  However, the dissolution of the Soviet Union prevented the mass production of the type.  The maiden flight of the first prototype took place on 16 December 1994 in Kiev, now independent Ukraine.  Within a year the prototype plane had suffered a mid-air collision.  A second airframe was produced and tests continued but numerous further attempts to start production have been unsuccessful.

March 29]\u00a01901 , Moscow \u2013 October 31, 1952, Gorky) was a Soviet physicist and member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (1946).  He worked extensively on the theory of stability of dynamical systems, introducing (together with Lev Pontryagin) the notion of structural stability.  In that context, he also contributed to the mathematical theory of self-oscillation (a term that he coined) by establishing a link between the generation of oscillations and the theory of Lyapunov stability.  He developed the comprehensive theory of self-oscillations by linking it with the qualitative theory of differential equations, topology, and with the general theory of stability of motion.  The crater Andronov on the Moon is named after him. In mathematics, the Thom space, Thom complex, or Pontryagin\u2013Thom construction (named after Ren\u00e9 Thom and Lev Pontryagin) of algebraic topology and differential topology is a topological space associated to a vector bundle, over any paracompact space.

In mathematics, Alexander duality refers to a duality theory presaged by a result of 1915 by J. W. Alexander, and subsequently further developed, particularly by P. S. Alexandrov and Lev Pontryagin.  It applies to the homology theory properties of the complement of a subspace \"X\" in Euclidean space, a sphere, or other manifold.  It is generalized by Spanier-Whitehead duality. Pontryagin's maximum (or minimum) principle is used in optimal control theory to find the best possible control for taking a dynamical system from one state to another, especially in the presence of constraints for the state or input controls.  It was formulated in 1956 by the Russian mathematician Lev Pontryagin and his students.  It has as a special case the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations. The Hamiltonian of optimal control theory was developed by Lev Pontryagin as part of his maximum principle.  It was inspired by, but is distinct from, the Hamiltonian of classical mechanics.  Pontryagin proved that a necessary condition for solving the optimal control problem is that the control should be chosen so as to minimize the Hamiltonian.  For details see Pontryagin's maximum principle. In mathematics, the Pontryagin classes, named for Lev Pontryagin, are certain characteristic classes.  The Pontryagin class lies in cohomology groups with degree a multiple of four.  It applies to real vector bundles.

He was born in Moscow and lost his eyesight due to a primus stove explosion when he was 14.  Despite his blindness he was able to become one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, partially with the help of his mother Tatyana Andreevna who read mathematical books and papers (notably those of Heinz Hopf, J. H. C. Whitehead, and Hassler Whitney) to him.  He made major discoveries in a number of fields of mathematics, including algebraic topology and differential topology. In mathematics, Tannaka\u2013Krein duality theory concerns the interaction of a compact topological group and its category of linear representations.  It is a natural extension of Pontryagin duality, between compact and discrete commutative topological groups, to groups that are compact but noncommutative.  The theory is named for two men, the Soviet mathematician Mark Grigorievich Krein, and the Japanese Tadao Tannaka.  In contrast to the case of commutative groups considered by Lev Pontryagin, the notion dual to a noncommutative compact group is not a group, but a category \u03a0(\"G\") with some additional structures, formed by the finite-dimensional representations of \"G\".", "question": "Lev Pontryagin and Leonty Magnitsky were both what?", "answer": "Both Lev Pontryagin and Leonty Magnitsky were Russian mathematicians.", "correct_answers": ["mathematician"]}, {"context": "Return of the Frog Queen is a solo album recorded by Jeremy Enigk while on hiatus from his post as singer of Sunny Day Real Estate.

Sunny Day Real Estate was an American emo band from Seattle, Washington.  They were one of the early emo bands and helped establish the genre.  In 1994, the band released their debut album \"Diary\" on Sub Pop Records to critical acclaim.  However, shortly after releasing their second album \"LP2\", the band broke up, with members Nate Mendel and William Goldsmith joining Foo Fighters and Jeremy Enigk embarking on a solo career.  In 1997, they regrouped long enough to record two more studio albums and a live album but ultimately disbanded once again in 2001.  The band reunited again in 2009.  Bassist Nate Mendel, who chose to remain with Foo Fighters during the previous reunion in 1997, took part in this reunion.  In a 2013 interview with MusicRadar, Mendel said Sunny Day Real Estate was inactive.  According to Mendel, the band attempted to record a full-length album after the end of their reunion tour, but the sessions \"just fell apart\".  In 2014 the band released one song from those sessions, \"Lipton Witch,\" on a split 7\" vinyl with Circa Survive on Record Store Day. Benton Falls was a rock band from Santa Rosa, California, which originally formed in 2000.

The band's music was influenced by such bands as Sunny Day Real Estate, Braid, and Jawbox.  They first appeared on the compilation \"The Silence In My Heart: The Emo Diaries Chapter Six\" and released their first full-length album, \"Fighting Starlight\", less than a month later on Deep Elm Records.  In the winter of 2000 the band went back into the recording studio to work on their follow-up album \"Guilt Beats Hate\", which was released in the spring of 2003.

They did not have the rights to the Huggy Bear side, and instead paired it with unreleased live tracks. Emo is a genre of rock music characterized by an emphasis on emotional expression, sometimes through confessional lyrics.  It emerged as a style of post-hardcore from the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore and pioneered by Washington, D.C. hardcore bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.

Based on the French play, \"Zelmire\" by de Belloy, it was the last of the composer's Neapolitan operas.  Stendhal called its music Teutonic, comparing it with \"La clemenza di Tito\" but remarking: \"...while Mozart would probably, had he lived, have grown completely Italian, Rossini may well, by the end of his career, have become more German than Beethoven himself!\" The critical reputation of the British composer Arthur Sullivan has fluctuated markedly in the 150 years since he came to prominence.  At first, critics regarded him as a potentially great composer of serious masterpieces.  When Sullivan made a series of popular successes in comic operas with the librettist W.S. Gilbert, Victorian critics generally praised the operettas but reproached Sullivan for not writing solemn choral works instead.  Immediately after Sullivan's death, his reputation was attacked by critics who condemned him for not taking part in what they conceived of as an \"English musical renaissance\".  By the latter part of the 20th century, Sullivan's music was being critically reassessed, beginning with the first book devoted to a study of his music, \"The Music of Arthur Sullivan\" by Gervase Hughes (1960). P\u00e9ch\u00e9s de vieillesse (\"Sins of Old Age\") is a collection of 150 vocal and solo piano pieces by composer Gioachino Rossini, who was best known for his operas.  The pieces are grouped into fourteen unpublished albums under this self-deprecating and ironic title.  The ordering of the pieces in the albums does not reflect the sequence or the dates of their composition, which range from 1857 to shortly before Rossini's death in 1868.

He later split from these groups and became associated with the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), founded in 1996 by Billy Wright. The Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) is a small Ulster loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland.  It was formed by Billy Wright in 1996 when he and his unit split from the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) after breaking its ceasefire.  They had belonged to the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade and Wright had been the brigade's commander.  In a two-year period from August 1996, the LVF waged a paramilitary campaign with the stated goal of combatting Irish republicanism.  During this time it killed at least 14 people in gun and bomb attacks.  Almost all of its victims were Catholic civilians who were killed at random.  The LVF called off its campaign in August 1998 and decommissioned some of its weapons, but in the early 2000s a loyalist feud led to a number of killings.  Since then, the LVF has been largely inactive, but its members are believed to have been involved in rioting and organized crime.  In 2015, the security forces stated that the LVF \"exists only as a criminal group\" in Mid-Ulster and Antrim. William Stephen \"Billy\" Wright (7 July 1960 \u2013 27 December 1997) was a prominent Ulster loyalist during the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles.  He joined the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in 1975 and became commander of its Mid-Ulster Brigade in the early 1990s, having taken over from Robin \"the Jackal\" Jackson.  According to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Wright was involved in the sectarian killings of up to 20 Catholics, although he was never convicted for any.  It has been alleged that Wright, like his predecessor, was an agent of the British security forces. The Red Hand Defenders (RHD) is an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland.  It was formed in 1998 by loyalists who opposed the Belfast Agreement and the loyalist ceasefires. Its members were drawn mostly from the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF).  The name had first been used by Red Hand Commandos dissident Frankie Curry in 1996 and he was the leading figure in what was a somewhat unstructured organization until he was killed in 1999.  It is named after the Red Hand of Ulster. William James \"Jim\" Fulton (born 25 November 1968) is a Northern Irish loyalist.

The Tandragee killings took place in the early hours of Saturday 19 February 2000 on an isolated country road outside Tandragee, County Armagh, Northern Ireland.  Two young Protestant men, Andrew Robb and David McIlwaine, were beaten and repeatedly stabbed to death in what was part of a Loyalist feud between the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and their rivals, the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF).  The men were not members of any loyalist paramilitary organisation.  It later emerged in court hearings that Robb had made disparaging remarks about the killing of UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade leader Richard Jameson by an LVF gunman the previous month.  This had angered the killers, themselves members of the Mid-Ulster UVF, and in retaliation they had lured the two men to the remote lane on the outskirts of town, where they killed and mutilated them. Richard Jameson (c. 1953 \u2013 10 January 2000), was a Northern Irish businessman and loyalist, who served as the leader of the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force's (UVF) Mid-Ulster Brigade.  He was killed outside his Portadown home during a feud with the rival Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), the breakaway organisation founded by former Mid-Ulster UVF commander Billy Wright after he and the Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster Brigade were officially stood down by the Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) in August 1996. A loyalist feud refers to any of the sporadic feuds which have erupted almost routinely between Northern Ireland's various loyalist paramilitary groups during and after the ethno-political conflict known as the Troubles broke out in the late 1960s.  The feuds have frequently involved problems between and within the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) as well as, later, the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, a total of 14 people were killed in Troubles-related violence in or near the village of Maghera, County Londonderry.  Of the 13 from Northern Ireland, 11 were Protestant and two were Catholic.  Seven of the Protestant victims were members of the security forces (six Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), two Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), one British Army) and another was the ten-year-old daughter of a UDR man, killed along with her father by a bomb planted in his car.  Another victim was shot after being mistaken for his co-worker, an UDR member.  Only three of the security force victims were killed while on-duty.  Both the RUC men were killed by the Irish National Liberation Army; all the other Protestant victims were killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.

In natural language processing, open information extraction (OIE) is the task of generating a structured, machine-readable representation of the information in text, usually in the form of triples or n-ary propositions.  A proposition can be understood as truth-bearer, a textual expression of a potential fact (e.g., \"Dante wrote the Divine Comedy\"), represented in an amenable structure for computers [e.g., (\"Dante\", \"wrote\", \"Divine Comedy\")].  An OIE extraction normally consists of a relation and a set of arguments.  For instance, (\"Dante\", \"passed away in\" \"Ravenna\") is a proposition formed by the relation \"passed away in\" and the arguments \"Dante\" and \"Ravenna\".  The first argument is usually referred as the subject while the second is considered to be the object.

In 2014, a series of protests, political demonstrations, and civil insurrection began in Venezuela due to the country's high levels of urban violence, inflation, and chronic shortages of basic goods attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls.  While protests occurred in January 2014, after the murder of actress and former Miss Venezuela M\u00f3nica Spear, mass protesting began in earnest that February following the attempted rape of a student on a university campus in San Crist\u00f3bal.

Formally, exponential utility is given by: In decision theory, the expected value of sample information (EVSI) is the expected increase in utility that a decision-maker could obtain from gaining access to a sample of additional observations before making a decision.  The additional information obtained from the sample may allow them to make a more informed, and thus better, decision, thus resulting in an increase in expected utility.  EVSI attempts to estimate what this improvement would be before seeing actual sample data; hence, EVSI is a form of what is known as \"preposterior analysis\". In economics, game theory, and decision theory the expected utility hypothesis, concerning people's preferences with regard to choices that have uncertain outcomes (gambles), states that if specific axioms are satisfied, the subjective value associated with an individual's gamble is the statistical expectation of that individual's valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.  Initiated by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, this hypothesis has proved useful to explain some popular choices that seem to contradict the expected value criterion (which takes into account only the sizes of the payouts and the probabilities of occurrence), such as occur in the contexts of gambling and insurance.  Until the mid-twentieth century, the standard term for the expected utility was the moral expectation, contrasted with \"mathematical expectation\" for the expected value. In decision theory, the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem shows that, under certain axioms of rational behavior, a decision-maker faced with risky (probabilistic) outcomes of different choices will behave as if he is maximizing the expected value of some function defined over the potential outcomes at some specified point in the future.  This function is known as the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function.  The theorem is the basis for expected utility theory. In decision theory, subjective expected utility is the attractiveness of an economic opportunity as perceived by a decision-maker in the presence of risk.  Characterizing the behavior of decision-makers as using subjective expected utility was promoted and axiomatized by L. J. Savage in 1954 following previous work by Ramsey and von Neumann.  The theory of subjective expected utility combines two subjective concepts: first, a personal utility function, and second a personal probability distribution (usually based on Bayesian probability theory). Generalized expected utility is a decision-making metric based on any of a variety of theories that attempt to resolve some discrepancies between expected utility theory and empirical observations, concerning choice under risky (probabilistic) circumstances. Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique.  Specifically, \"Q\"-learning can be used to find an optimal action-selection policy for any given (finite) Markov decision process (MDP).  It works by learning an action-value function that ultimately gives the expected utility of taking a given action in a given state and following the optimal policy thereafter.  A policy is a rule that the agent follows in selecting actions, given the state it is in.  When such an action-value function is learned, the optimal policy can be constructed by simply selecting the action with the highest value in each state.  One of the strengths of \"Q\"-learning is that it is able to compare the expected utility of the available actions without requiring a model of the environment.  Additionally, \"Q\"-learning can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring any adaptations.  It has been proven that for any finite MDP, \"Q\"-learning eventually finds an optimal policy, in the sense that the expected value of the total reward return over all successive steps, starting from the current state, is the maximum achievable. Daniel Bernoulli FRS ( ; ] ; 8 February 1700 \u2013 17 March 1782) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family.

His name is commemorated in the Bernoulli's principle, a particular example of the conservation of energy, which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century: the carburetor and the airplane wing. David Schmeidler (born 1939) is an Israeli mathematician and economic theorist with important contributions in the theory of individual decision making under uncertainty (decision theory).  He currently holds professorships at Ohio State University and Tel Aviv University.  He received his PhD in Mathematics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of Robert Aumann.  His most influential works include the theories of Choquet expected utility and maxmin expected utility (the latter jointly with Itzhak Gilboa).  Both these theories explain individual attitudes towards ambiguity that are consistent with the Ellsberg paradox. The rank-dependent expected utility model (originally called anticipated utility) is a generalized expected utility model of choice under uncertainty, designed to explain the behaviour observed in the Allais paradox, as well as for the observation that many people both purchase lottery tickets (implying risk-loving preferences) and insure against losses (implying risk aversion).", "question": "The Expected utility hypothesis was initiated by which Swiss mathematician in 1738?", "answer": "Daniel Bernoulli.", "correct_answers": ["Daniel Bernoulli"]}, {"context": "In the sport of cricket, two batsmen always bat in partnership, although only one is on strike at any time.  The partnership between two batsmen will come to an end when one of them is dismissed or retires, or the innings comes to a close (usually due to victory being achieved, a declaration, a time or over limit being reached, or the match being abandoned in mid-innings for inclement weather or, exceptionally, dangerous playing conditions).  Various statistics may be used to describe a partnership, most notably the number of runs scored during it (either by the batsmen or as extras), the duration of the partnership both in time (usually quoted in minutes) and number of deliveries (balls) faced.  Partnerships are often described as being for a particular wicket (for example, a \"third wicket partnership\", also called a \"third wicket stand\"\u2014in this context, the \"opening partnership\" between the two opening batsmen is the \"first wicket partnership\").  This has the anomalous result that a partnership may be between more than two batsmen, if one of the original batsmen retires hurt but not out, since the particular numbered wicket will not have fallen yet.

It is located between the North Sea (i.e. north of the United Kingdom) and the Greenland Sea and adjoins the North Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Barents Sea to the northeast.  In the southwest, it is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a submarine ridge running between Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  To the North, the Jan Mayen Ridge separates it from the Greenland Sea. The Greenland Sea is a body of water that borders Greenland to the west, the Svalbard archipelago to the east, Fram Strait and the Arctic Ocean to the north, and the Norwegian Sea and Iceland to the south.  The Greenland Sea is often defined as part of the Arctic Ocean, sometimes as part of the Atlantic Ocean.  However, definitions of the Arctic Ocean and its seas tend to be imprecise or arbitrary.  In general usage the term \"Arctic Ocean\" would exclude the Greenland Sea.  In oceanographic studies the Greenland Sea is considered part of the Nordic Seas, along with the Norwegian Sea.  The Nordic Seas are the main connection between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and, as such, could be of great significance in a possible shutdown of thermohaline circulation.  In oceanography the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas are often referred to collectively as the \"Arctic Mediterranean Sea\", a marginal sea of the Atlantic. Narrow-snouted pipefish (\"Syngnathus tenuirostris\") is a pipefish species, inhabits the Mediterranean basin: Adriatic Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, and Black Sea.  Marine demersal, ovoviviparous fish.

It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba.  The U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \"Third Coast\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \"south coast\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \"north coast.\"  One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. The Yukon-Tanana Terrane (YTT) is a tectonic terrane that extends from central Alaska through central Yukon and into northern British Columbia, Canada and Southeast Alaska, USA.  Extending over 2000 km, the YTT is the largest tectonostratigraphic terrane in the northern North American Cordillera.  The Yukon-Tanana Upland is a physiographic province mostly underlain by rocks of the Yukon-Tanana terrane.  The YTT consists of polymetamorphosed and polydeformed metasedimentary, metavolcanic, and metaplutonic rocks of Upper Paleozoic and older ages that were deposited or emplaced near the edge of the North American continental margin.  Rocks in the terrane record a variety of tectonic settings and have experienced varying amounts of tectonic transport, both before and after amalgamation of the YTT with North America.  Sequences of mainly parautochthonous quartz-rich sedimentary rocks derived from the North American continent also include meta-igneous rocks with mostly continental geochemical and isotopic signatures.  Structurally higher sequences contain meta-igneous rocks with arc and back-arc characteristics.  The Slide Mountain/Seventymile terrane, composed of volcanic rocks typical of seafloor and of typical seafloor sediments, is recognized as an ocean basin that divided parts of the YTT before amalgamation of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane with the continental margin. A coastal state is a state in the United States of America that borders a major body of water, such as an ocean or lake.  There are three oceans that border the United States: the Pacific Ocean (this includes the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea), the Atlantic Ocean/Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic Ocean (this includes the Chukchi Sea and the Beaufort Sea).  The Great Lakes are contained inside the North American continent and consist of Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. Baffin Bay (Inuktitut: \"Saknirutiak Imanga\"; Greenlandic: \"Avannaata Imaa\" ; French: \"Baie de Baffin\" ), located between Baffin Island and the southwest coast of Greenland, is a marginal sea of the North Atlantic Ocean.  It is connected to the Atlantic via Davis Strait and the Labrador Sea.  The narrower Nares Strait connects Baffin Bay with the Arctic Ocean.  The bay is not navigable most of the year because of the ice cover and high density of floating ice and icebergs in the open areas.  However, a polynya of about 80,000 km2 , known as the North Water, opens in summer on the north near Smith Sound.  Most of the aquatic life of the bay is concentrated near that region. The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.  An epeiric (or \"shelf\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north.  It is more than 970 km long and 580 km wide, with an area of around 570000 km2 .

The Blake Plateau, associated Blake Ridge and Blake Basin are named for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer George S. Blake, in service 1874-1905, that first used steel cable for oceanographic operations and pioneered deep ocean and Gulf Stream exploration.

The \"F\u00fchrer\" Headquarters (\"F\u00fchrerhauptquartiere\" in German), abbreviated FHQ, is a common name for a number of official headquarters used by the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and various German commanders and officials throughout Europe during the Second World War.  Perhaps the most widely known headquarters was the \"F\u00fchrerbunker\" in Berlin, Germany, where Hitler committed suicide on 30 April 1945.  Other notable headquarters are the \"Wolfsschanze\" (Wolf's Lair) in East Prussia, where Claus von Stauffenberg in league with other conspirators attempted to assassinate Hitler on 20 July 1944, and Hitler's private home, the \"Berghof\", at Obersalzberg near Berchtesgaden, where he frequently met with prominent foreign and domestic officials. On 20 July 1944, Claus von Stauffenberg and other conspirators attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler, F\u00fchrer of Nazi Germany, inside his Wolf's Lair field headquarters near Rastenburg, East Prussia.  The name Operation Valkyrie, originally referring to part of the conspiracy, has become associated with the entire event.  The apparent aim of the assassination attempt was to wrest political control of Germany and its armed forces from the Nazi Party (including the SS) and to make peace with the western Allies as soon as possible.  The underlying desire of many of the high-ranking Wehrmacht officers involved was apparently to show the world that not all Germans were like Hitler and the Nazi Party.

It has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism.

It also deals with the Right of Return for Jewish diaspora.  In general, Israel's nationality follows jus sanguinis as the primary mechanism through which a person may obtain citizenship, rather than jus soli.

A British protected person (BPP) is a member of a class of certain persons under the British Nationality Act 1981 associated with former protected states, protectorates, mandated and trust territories under British control.  The inhabitants of these former states or territories were never automatically entitled because of their birthplace to become British subjects or citizens, but were given the status of British protected person instead.  (A few of those born in such areas might have other claims to British nationality; for example, one based on the status of their parents.) Under international law, a refugee is a person who has fled his or her own country of nationality or habitual residence, and cannot return due to fear of persecution on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, and is unable or unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of persecution.  These recent migration movements are caused by a variety of reasons.  Some of the refugees stay in refugee camps, some are urban refugees in individual accommodations, some stay in self-settled camps and for some refugees the location is undefined or unknown by UNHCR. Nationality law (or citizenship law) is the law in each country and in each jurisdiction within each country which defines the rights and obligations of citizenship within the jurisdiction and the manner in which citizenship is acquired as well as how citizenship may be lost.  A person who is not a citizen of the country is generally regarded as a foreigner, also referred to as an alien.  A person who has no recognised nationality or citizenship is regarded as stateless. The Second Coming of Suzanne (also known as Suzanne) is a 1974 American drama film directed by Michael Barry.  It stars Jared Martin as an obsessed San Francisco indie film maker who hires a beautiful young woman called Suzanne (played by Sondra Locke) to star as a female Christ in his next film.  Paul Sand co-stars as Suzanne's artist boyfriend.  Richard Dreyfuss appears as a member of the crew who becomes concerned at the increasingly weird antics of the rest of the ensemble, which culminate in the crucifixion of Suzanne on a local hill.  The film was inspired by the lyrics of Leonard Cohen's song \"Suzanne\", as heard on the soundtrack.  The director's father Gene Barry is also featured, as a TV presenter, in a somewhat opaque sub-plot. Nationality is a legal relationship between an individual person and a state.  Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the state.  What these rights and duties are vary from state to state.

He was a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honor.  In 2011, Cohen received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize. Multiple citizenship, also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or dual nationality, is a person's citizenship status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one state under the laws of those states.  There is no international convention which determines the nationality or citizen status of a person, which is defined exclusively by national laws, which vary and can be inconsistent with each other.  Multiple citizenship arises because different countries use different, and not necessarily mutually exclusive, criteria for citizenship.

A wind controller, sometimes referred to as a \"wind synth\", or \"wind synthesizer\", is a wind instrument capable of controlling one or more music synthesizers or other devices.  Wind controllers are most commonly played and fingered like a woodwind instrument, usually the saxophone, with the next most common being brass fingering, particularly the trumpet.  Models have been produced that play and finger like other acoustic instruments such as the recorder or the tin whistle.  One form of wind controller, the hardware-based variety, uses electronic sensors to convert fingering, breath pressure, bite pressure, finger pressure, and other gesture information into control signals.  Another form of wind controller uses software to convert the acoustic sound of an unmodified wind instrument directly into MIDI messages.  In either case, the control signals or MIDI messages generated by the wind controller are used to control internal or external devices such as analog synthesizers or MIDI-compatible synthesizers, softsynths, sequencers, or even lighting systems.

He was associated with the International General Electric Company from 1900 until his retirement in 1945.  He founded the General Electric subsidiary in Brazil and participated in the lighting of the Strait of Magellan in 1906. General Electric Research Laboratory, the first industrial research facility in the United States, was established in 1900.  It is located in Schenectady, New York.  Schenectady is nicknamed \"The City that Lights and Hauls the World.\"  This lab was home to the early technological breakthroughs of General Electric and created a research and development environment that set the standard for industrial innovation for years to come.  It developed into GE Global Research that now covers an array of technological research, ranging from healthcare to transportation systems, at multiple locations throughout the world.  It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975. The General Electric J47 turbojet (GE company designation TG-190) was developed by General Electric from its earlier J35.  It first flew in May 1948.  The J47 was the first axial-flow turbojet approved for commercial use in the United States.  It was used in many types of aircraft, and more than 30,000 were manufactured before production ceased in 1956.  It saw continued service in the US military until 1978.  Packard built 3,025 of the engines under license. The General Electric TF39 was a high-bypass turbofan engine developed to power the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.  The TF39 was the very first high-power, high-bypass jet engine ever developed.  The TF39 was further developed into the CF6 series of engines, and formed the basis of the General Electric LM2500 marine and industrial gas turbine.  On September 7, 2017 the very last active C-5A powered with TF39 engines made its final flight to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base for retirement.  The TF39 was effectively retired and all remaining active C-5 Galaxys are now powered with General Electric F138-GE-100 engines. Scott C. Donnelly (born 1961) is the CEO of Textron.

According to another version, agreed by Keating and the Four Masters, S\u00edrna was killed by Rothechtaid Rotha at Alind.
