<H2>Kaldi &amp; the Dancing Goats</H2>There are many versions of
how coffee came to be but by far the most famous is that of Kaldi &amp;
the Dancing Goats.<P></P>"Once upon a time in the land of Arabia Felix,
there lived a goatherd named Kaldi.  Kaldi was a sober responsible
goatherd whose goats were also sober, if not responsible.  One night,
Kaldi's goats didn't come home, and in the morning he found them dancing
with abandoned glee near a shiny, dark-leafed shrub with red berries. 
Kaldi soon determined that it was the red berries on the shiny,
dark-leafed shrub that caused the goats' eccentric behavior, and it
wasn't long before he was dancing too.<P>Finally, a learned imam from a
local monastery came by, sleppily, no doubt, on his way to prayer.  He
saw the goats dancing, Kaldi dancing, and the shiny, dark-leafed shrub
with the red berries.  Being of a more systematic turn of mind that the
goats or Kaldi, the learned imam subjected the red berries to various
experimental examinations, one of which involved parching and boiling. 
Soon neither the imam nor his fellows fell asleep at prayers, and the
use of coffee spread from monastery to monastery, throughout Arabia
Felix, and from there to the rest of the world." </P><P></P> <B><I>(Coffee:
