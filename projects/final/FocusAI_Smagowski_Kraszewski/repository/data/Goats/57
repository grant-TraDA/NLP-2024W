Cypress Park, Grouse Mountain, Mount Seymour and Lynn Canyon provide access to many peaks within minutes of North Vancouver and within half an hour of the rest of the metropolitan population.<P>

<IMG Width=200 Height=135 Align=left Vspace=5 Hspace=10 Border=1 SRC="3.jpg">On top of <STRONG>Coliseum Mountain</STRONG>, looking westward at the Haynes valley that joins Lynn Canyon and Grouse Mountain trails. The peak on the left is Goat Mountain and the predominant peak on the range in the middle of the photo and just right of the valley is Crown Mountain. Both Goat and Crown mountain are readily accessible from Grouse Mountain. Depending on your level of fitness it can take 3-6 hours to get on Coliseum Peak. The adjacent Mount Burwell is well worth the additional 1-2 hours stroll if you still have some energy and have timed things so you'll get back in daylight.

Located on top of <STRONG>Grouse Mountain</STRONG> is Glen Greensides "tribute to the forest" collection. Glen has spent the past few years locating discarded timber that has been lying on the forest floor for decades, and then uses his chainsaw to transform them into these impressive works. How to get on top of <STRONG>Grouse Mountain</STRONG>? Either pay about $15.00 to take the Gondola up in 7 minutes or walk up in about 1-2 hours depending on your level of conditioning.
