<li><a href="howto.html">Writing Together</a> or how you can use the <a href="ting.html">Ting, a consensus decision-making group, modeled after the form of meeting used by <a href="">Viking chieftains</a>.  Ting was the name of the bell that any member in good standing could use to call the others together for an important task or discussion.  We&#39;ve taken advantage of the <a href="<A HREF="http://www.digivis.com/ajaja/Friends.html">Quaker Friends&#39;</a> experience with running such meetings and added a large helping of <a href="">Creative Problem Solving</a> methodology to create a group problem solving method that can be used to weave a single GOaTzine article from a class-full of ideas and research.  Give it a try!.</a>
