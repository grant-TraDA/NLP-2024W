We raise two different types of goats.
<ul>
<Li> <A HREF = "DairyGoats.html">Dairy Goats</A> are raised for goat milk.  They 
also
make good companions, go to petting zoos, and we show them at fairs.

<Li> <A HREF = "Pygmy.html">Pygmy Goats</A> are raised primarily for show.  Like 
dairy goats, they are good companions, and they go to shows, fairs, and petting zoos.  
</ul>

Female goats are called does. Male goats are called bucks. We primarily raise does because 
they are easier to manage, they don't have an offensive odor (unlike bucks), 
and there are more shows for does.  A male goat that has been neutered is known as a 
wether.  We usually don't keep dairy goat wethers, but some kids raise and show pygmy 
wethers.

Other domesticated goats include <A HREF = "Boer.html">Boer goats</A>
that are starting to be raised for meat, <a HREF =
"Cashmire.html">Cashmere goats</a> that are raised for cashmere and <a
href="Dwarf.html">Nigerian Dwarf goats</a>.  Domesticated goats differ
from wild goats such as <a href="MountainGoat.gif">Mountain goats</a>.

<h3> Why raising goats is fun</h3>

Goats are fun because they all have different personalities and have
different little habits that can be amusing or interesting.  Goats are
very affectionate and especially during the summer, when they are too
hot to be active, they like to just hang around people and get a good
scratch.  Most goats' favorite scratchy spot is around their shoulder
but some even liked to be scratched in between their toes.  It is very
rewarding to see a goat you have raised from a baby grow up and have
kids and grandkids of her own.  With goats that doesn't have too take
too long, maybe about 3 or 4 years at most, because they are able to
breed when they are just a year old.  It's also neat to learn how to
milk or trim hooves and other things that you wouldn't ordinarily be
able to do.

<HR><a name = "Stats"> </a>
<h3> Goat Statistics </h3>
<ul>
<li> Body Temperature:  102.5&#176 F-104&#176 F 
<li> Pulse/heart rate:  60 to 80 beats per minute
<li> Respiration rate:  15 to 30 breaths per minute
<li> Puberty:  4 to 12 months
<li> Estrus ("heat") cycle:  18 to 23 days
<li> Length of each "heat":  12 to 36 hours
<li> Gestation (length of pregnancy):   <a href =Birthdate.html>150 days</a><img src=new.gif>
<li> Breeding season:   Pygmy goats may be bred any time of the year.  Dairy goats 
usually go into heat between August and January in the Northern Hemisphere.
<li> Weight: An adult pygmy goat weighs between 50 and 75 pounds. An adult dairy goat 
doe weighs between 125 and 200 pounds. An adult dairy goat buck weighs between 200 
and 300 pounds.
</ul>

<HR><a name = "healthy"> </a>
<h3> A healthy goat </h3>
<ul><li>Eyes clear and bright.   Tearing or cloudy eyes probably mean a pinkeye infection.
<li>Coat smooth and shiny.   A dull coat could indicate parasites.  Fluffed up coat means 
the goat is not feeling well.
<li>Appetite good.   However, it is normal for a doe in labor to refuse to eat.
<li>Attitude alert.   Hunched back and droopy tail mean something is wrong.

</ul>


<HR><a name = "care"> </a>
<h3> Basic care </h3>
Like any other animal, a goat can survive without food for several days, but not without 
water.  We provide automatic waterers in goat pens, and also leave a
bucket of water.  In some areas, of the country, its important to make sure the
water doesn't freeze, but we don't have that problem.<p>

Although many goat owners feel that a twice daily feeding is best, others feed only once a 
day and still have perfectly healthy goats.  You will have to decide what is practical for 
your animal and your schedule.   Try to keep both food and water where they cannot be 
soiled by the goat. <p>

The basic food we feed is alfalfa hay. An adult  dairy goat doe eats about  1/2 flake a day 
(about 5 pounds).  This is supplemented with a grain mixture that contains 14-16% protein
depending on the additional needs of the goat:
<ul>
<li> Dairy doe in milk: 2-3 pounds
<li> Pygmy doe in milk: 1-2 pounds
<li> Dry doe:  0-1 pounds
<li> Pregnant doe: (last 1-2 months) 1-2 pounds
<li> Wethers: Usually given no grain.
</ul>

We also provide either a loose mineral mix or a mineral brick. Since
alfalfa hay is high in calcium, we make sure the mineral mix is high
in phosphorous and low in calcium to maintain the proper
calcium-to-phosphorous ratio. <p>

Although this diet works for us, we suggest you consult with a local
goat breeder or veterinarian who is more familiar with the nutritional
needs of your goats and the nutritional value of the feed in your
area.

<HR><a name = "prevention"> </a>
<h3> Preventative health care </h3>

In our area, there are three types of injections that the goats need
regularly: Tetanus toxiod, BoSe and a vacination for enterotoxemia.
We give 1/2 cc. of tetanus toxiod yearly (usually one month before a
doe is about to kid). BoSe contains selenium and vitamin E and is
necessary to maintain muscle tone in adults and prevent "white muscle
disease" in kids.  Because hay in our area is low in Selenium, our
goats receive 1 cc. of BoSe intramuscularly for every 40 pounds of
body weight twice a year.  The best time for bred does to receive BoSe
is about one month before they kid and then 5 months after they kid.
Babies should have their first injection at six weeks of age (1/2 cc),
unless they need it sooner to correct a problem. For enterotoxemia the
Clostridium Perfringens types C&D bacterin-toxoid vacination is given.
It is often combined with a tetanus toxiod in brand names such as
Bar-VAC CD/T or FERMACON CD/T. First course requires two doses at
21-28 days interval. The dose is 2ml SQ in the web of the elbow.
Until recently yearly boosters were the norm, but vets are just now
beginning to recommend twice yearly vaccinations.  When using the
combined CD/T it is not necessary to have a separate tetanus toxiod
vaccine.

<P><b> Check with a
local vet to make sure goats in your area need selenium, and that the
doses we use are appropriate for goats in your area and the brand of
injectible you use.  Overdoses of BoSe or injecting it to goats who
receive selenium as part of their diet may be fatal.  In your area,
additional vaccines for other diseases may be
necessary. </b> <p>

We deworm our goats twice yearly: in the fall before breeding and in
the spring immediately following kidding.  We use TBZ or paste wormers
intended for horses ivermectin (Zimectrin) or pyrantel tartrate
(Strongid C). <b>Caution: check the label or ask your veterinarian
whether the product can safely be given to a pregnant goat.  Check
labels for withdrawal time if you use the milk for human consumption.
</b>



<HR><a name = "diseases"> </a>
<h3> Common  Diseases </h3>

<b>Coccidia</b> are tiny intestinal parasites, actually protozoans, that can
cause foamy, bloody diarrhea or a dull, dry coat.  Sometimes a goat
with coccidiosis (coccidia infestation) has an on-again-off-again soft
stool or no obvious symptoms at all.  You might not suspect a problem
until you notice that your kids are not growing as well as they
should.  Young kids up to four months of age are at highest risk and
should be treated at least once with the medication Albon.  Our
veterinarian recommends that they receive Albon for one week beginning
at about three or four weeks of age and again if they are very
stressed, such as when separated from their mother. If in doubt, take
a stool sample to a veterinarian who regularly treats goats.
<p>


 <b>Ketosis</b> (also known  as pregnancy toxemia) may occur in pregnant does late in their pregnancy. The
 doe  may be depressed,
 weak, uninterested in food, and have poor muscle control and balance.  
 If untreated, death follows within a few days. Early  in  the
 disease, many does will show a positive test for
 ketone bodies in the urine.  
 Ketosis may occur
 when the doe is carrying two or more kids, or when
 the doe is very fat.  This disease is caused by the
 sudden extra demand for energy by the fast-growing
 kids in the pregnant goat and the inability of the goat
 to eat enough  of her normal diet to provide  this energy
 (due to the kids taking up room in the body). The doe will  rapidly
 metabolize fat from her body stores produces ketones (a toxic
 by-product) and the symptoms of the disease. Treatment with propylene glycol at
 two to three ounces  twice a day will help.
 If the doe lies down and cannot stand, treatment is usually not successful
 unless she delivers at that time.   
 As a preventive measure,  do not let the doe
 get fat early in pregnancy and in the last month
 of pregnancy provide 1-2 pounds of grain in addition to hay. 
 <p>

    <b><a href=CAE.html>Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Syndrome</a> </b>(CAE)
is a viral disease.  In young kids  symptoms include
 a weakness in the rear legs, with no fever, or loss of appetite,  However,
  the unused  legs  lose  muscle  strength  and
 structure and the infected kids eventually die.
  In older goats, the same disease is seen as
 swollen joints, particularly the knees.   The disease develops slowly, and
 after 2 or more years, the animal has difficulty using
 its legs properly.   Infected goats have no fever,
 remain alert, and eat well.  However, they do not
 recover from the arthritis. 
 An inexpensive blood tests can be used to diagnose CAE.
 The disease is spread from older infected goats to kids, perhaps by
 contact or
 through the milk from an infected doe to her kid. There are no corrective
 procedures or treatments.  Isolating kids at birth and raising them on
 pasteurized goat milk is done to prevent the spread. It's a good idea
 to make sure a goat is CAE free before purchasing. However, the blood test
only checks for antibodies, and it's possible that an animal is infected and not
(yet) producing antibodies.
<p>
 <b>Mastitis</b>  is  an  inflammation  of  the mammary
 gland  (udder  or  milk-giving  gland)  of  animals,
 usually caused by bacteria. The symptoms
 of mastitis are heat,  pain,  and swelling of  the
 udder.  Usually you will notice some discoloration of
 the tissue and abnormal milk.   The infected udder
 will change in color from slightly more pink to a
 bright red, or to a black and cold udder. The milk from an
 infected udder will vary in color,  texture,  and
 thickness.   The California Mastitis Test (CMT) is  a good test for
 subclinical mastitis, but is not 100% accurate.  Laboratory culture or
 growth of the bacteria causing the mastitis is the best way to determine
 the exact diagnosis.  
 
 The causes of mastitis are most commonly rough treatment
 and unclean milking practices. Wash the goat's udder
 before milking, and dip (or spray) the teats after milking
 with a teat dip.  Wash your hands before milking each goat
 to prevent the spread.  The treatment  consists
 of an intramammary infusion of antibiotics, sometimes
 accompanied by additional antibiotics. Consulting a vet
 is important for this disease since there are many different bacteria
 that cause mastitis and different antibiotics are best for each.  If
untreated the infection spreads and the goat may die or lose the udder.
 

<HR><a name = "Breeding"> </a>
<h3> Breeding</h3>

A dairy goat should weigh at least 80 pounds and be at least 8 months
old the first time she is bred.  A pygmy goat should be between 9 and
18 months and a good size for her age.  In order for the doe to
conceive (become pregnant), she must be in estrus ("heat" or
"season".)  Signs of estrus include flagging (wagging her tail),
mucous discharging from her rear, mounting other goats, and excited
behavior if she is near a buck.  At first, you'll probably breed your
does to a buck of a local breeder, but eventually, you might want to
consider <A HREF = "AI.html">owning your own buck or artificial
insemination</A>.  A good indication that a doe is pregnant is that
it does not come into heat on its next cycle, so check your goat
carefully three weeks after breeding. It may be hard to determine if a
dairy goat is pregnant if it was bred at the end of the breeding
season.


<HR><a name = "labor"> </a> <h3> Labor</h3> 

The <a href=Birthdate.html>expected due date</a><img src="new.gif"> is
150 days after breeding.  A few weeks before delivery, the goat's
udder will usually become enlarged.  A day or two before birth, the
udder often fills up and the pelvic ligaments at the base of the tail
relax so that the tail feels loose. Frequent urination and low pitched
bleating are also signs that labor will begin within a day or two.

The first sign we usually notice that indicates that labor is imminent
is the discharge of the mucous plug, followed by small amounts of
mucous.  In our experience, this usually occurs an hour or two before
birth.  <p> In the uterus, the kid is enclosed in an amniotic sac
which is surrounded by a water sac.  Usually the water sac bursts 30
minutes to 2 hours before the delivery of the first kid.  The amniotic
sac might burst a few minutes before delivery.  Usually, a kid will
be born front legs and head first, and no assistance is needed. In
multiple births, each kid is usually delivery 5-30 minutes after the
previous sibling, and the placenta is expelled a few hours later. <p>
<A HREF="Birth.gif"><img src="Birth.gif"></A>
<p>

If the kids haven't arrived within two hours after the water sac breaks,
or if the kid is not positioned properly, an experienced goat breeder
or a veterinarian might be required to assist in the delivery by
repositioning the kid or "pulling" the kid out.

<HR><a name = "newborn"> </a>
<h3> Care of newborn goats </h3>

Usually, the doe will lick the kid, to remove mucous and to stimulate
its breathing. With a weak kid or inattentive mother, you might want
to make sure the kid is freed from the amniotic sac and the mouth and
nose are free of mucous.  It is not necessary to cut the umbilical
cord, but if there is excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord of
the kid, we tie it with dental floss.  Within an hour of birth, we dip
the umbilical cord in 7% iodine to prevent infections.<p>

Usually within a half hour, the kids will attempt to stand and nurse.
It is important that the kids nurse within the first few hours of
birth to receive colostrum which provides immunoglobulins.<p>

Before the kids reach ten days old, they are dehorned.  Before
dehorning, we administer tetanus antitoxin to provide temporary
protection against tetanus. Often at the time of dehorning male kids
are castrated (also known as wethered). At one month of age, we
usually give tetanus toxiod (repeated one month later for newborns)
and BoSe. The BoSe is repeated every six months and the tetanus toxiod
is repeated yearly.
