cDNA Sequence Analysis Project</A>
</h2>

<dd>The <i>Arabidopsis</i> cDNA Sequence Analysis Project is a joint effort
between the University of Minnesota's Plant Molecular Informatics Center
(PMIC) and Michigan State University, and it is
funded by the National Science Foundation, under grants
BIR 940-2380 and BIR 931-3751.
This project combines both software and database development, seeking to
provide alternative views into analyzed data.

<h3> Rice, Corn, Pine and Others</h3>

<P>
In addition to the work with <i>Arapidopsis</i>, other cDNA analysis projects have been undertaken by PMIC to transfer
<a href="general_cdna/general_top.html">sequence analysis tools</a> developed
for
<i>Arabidopsis</i> to other plants:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>The <a href="Rice/top.html"> Rice cDNA Project
</a>
at the Rice Genome Research Program at STAFF Institute in Tsukuba, Japan;

<LI>The <a href="AZ.corn/top.html"> Corn cDNA Project
</a>
at the University of Arizona;

<LI>The <a href="Loblolly/top.html"> Loblolly Pine cDNA Project
</a>
at the Institute of Forest Genetics, USDA Pacific Southwest Research
Station of the Forest Service; and

<LI>A sequencing project for an anonymous client.

</UL>

<P>
We are grateful for the cooperation of
Carolyn Tolstoshev and Mark Boguski of NCBI's dbEST; their assistance and
encouragement in this work has been invaluable and appreciated.

<P>
You may be interested in finding out about having PMIC process your sequences.
(UNDER CONSTRUCTION. A link will be put in shortly.)
<P>
Note:  We have also applied these tools to other organisms, as seen in the
<a href="zebrafish/zfish_top_page.html">
Zebrafish Project.

<dt><h2>The PCR <I>In Situ</I></h2>
<dd>
While the polymerase chain reaction provides an extremely powerful tool
for the analysis of populations of cells, the PCR <I>In Situ</I> extends this 
technology to the single cell level.  In part due to the newness of the
technique, and in part to respond to demand for detailed information, 
pre-prints of articles and in-press book chapters, as well as a cookbook of protocols,
have been made <a href="insitu_pcr/top_page.html">available</a>.

<dt><h2>The Hidden Layers: A Fluid Molecular Biology Didactic Platform</h2>
<dd>
Teaching a course on state of the art molecular biology is challenging
as the underlying technologies advance faster than print support media can
accomodate.  In addition, the essential computational tools are generally
ignored as the difficulty of supporting multiple platforms and capacities
are virtually insurmountable.  This project 
<a href="recombinant_dna/recombinant_flowchart.html">(A Recombinant DNA 
Technology Course)</A> seeks to remove the barriers
by using net-based resources [Mosaic], desktop publishing technologies,
client-server computing, device-independent graphics and imaging and
an array of computational tools operating on remote servers.

<li>An unofficial <a href="MolBio_man/MolBio_man.html">GCG Software Guide</a>.
<li><a href="zuker/mfold.html">Zuker's Mfold Manual</a>, for prediction of RNA Secondary Structure.
<li>The <a href="doc/osp/intr2.html">Oligo Selection Program</a>, an aid in selecting oligonucleotide primers
for DNA sequencing an PCR.
<li><a href="http://xplor.csb.yale.edu">X-PLOR</a>, used to determine molecular structure by X-ray
crystallography and solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
