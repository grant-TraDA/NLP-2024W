<H1>Welcome to BIOSCI!</H1>

</CENTER><P>

BIOSCI is a set of electronic communication forums - the bionet USENET
newsgroups and parallel e-mail lists - used by biological scientists
worldwide.  No fees are charged for the service.  BIOSCI is currently
supported in the U.S. by a grant from DOE with equipment from NSF.  The
U.K. BIOSCI node is supported by the Daresbury Laboratory.  <P>

<P>
THE U.S. BIOSCI NODE IS CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR SPONSORS TO HELP
CONTINUE ITS WORK WHEN THE DOE GRANT ENDS.  Sponsors will be able to
have their logo listed in this space, have a hyperlink to their home
page, and gain other advertising exposure through our gopher site and
BIOSCI documentation.  Please contact
<A HREF="mailto:biosci-help@net.bio.net">biosci-help@net.bio.net</A> for
details on how your organization can help BIOSCI continue its service
to the biology community. <P>

BIOSCI promotes communication between professionals in the
biological sciences.  All postings to the newsgroups should be made in
that spirit.  While the general public may "listen in" to the
discussions, these newsgroups are intended primarily for
communications between researchers.  There are other forums on Usenet
such as sci.bio for the asking and answering of biological questions
from lay persons. <P>
