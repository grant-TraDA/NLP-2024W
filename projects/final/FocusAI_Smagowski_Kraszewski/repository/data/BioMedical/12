 ASM Journals</h3>
<hr>
<p>


<p>

The American Society for Microbiology has traditionally produced superior-quality journals
covering the entire spectrum of microbiology.  These publications maintain the highest standards
of excellence, whether for reviews or for basic research articles, and attract authors who are
highly respected worldwide.  <p>

<p>

<b>ASM journals are available in both print and on CD-ROM.</b>  For 1996 subscriptions, the CD-ROM format is available for Windows and Macintosh.  The CD-ROM version is mailed
monthly, just like the printed version.  The system can display and print both ASCII text and
exact page images and allows viewers to perform a variety of full-text searches.  Command line
languages are English, French, Spanish, and German.  At the end of a subscription year, archival
CD-ROMs are available for easy storage.<p>

<b>Member  Subscriptions:</b>
