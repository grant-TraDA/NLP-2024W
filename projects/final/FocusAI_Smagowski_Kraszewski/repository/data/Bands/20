<I>Ordinary Man</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All I am, an ordinary man, and Ive got some very ordinary plans I like
to sit down, think, and figure out where my life is going and just what
its been about.  Time, time to look ahead Time, time to look behind
<P>
Planning for the future Ill evaluate my needs, do my best and try to
make each dream reality Not everything I do will all work out, like all
of us, I make mistakes, a less-than-perfect cut.  And it bleeds, I see
red blood run Scars go deep, and the pain lives on
<P>
There are those days when I want to...
<P>
Days turn into months turn into years, yesterdays as far away as
tomorrows getting near And here I am an ordinary man, someday Ill be
memories, someday Ill be dust.  Time, time to look ahead Time, time to
look behind

Look at me. Its not true that no-one cares. Ill give you what kindness
I can afford, but theres something I want in return:  No more penance
for the power you were born with; a gift is not a crime. All you owe
the world is a healthy respect. Dont let it kill your light.
<P>
Dont be afraid of the sun inside you, unveil that secret heat Youre not
quite alone, and youre exactly as strong as you feel you need to be.
<P>
Dont whine at me about the weight of the world, it comes down
everywhere. As friends, we can only try to even out the load, and make
it a little less unfair. Pressures inside build a burning diamond, and
though were all a little flawed, still if you look hard enough youll
find that inner light where they got the idea for God.
<P>
Dont be afraid...
