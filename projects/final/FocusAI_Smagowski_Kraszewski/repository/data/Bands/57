<H2> "Tom Waits meets Tracey Ullman."</H2><P>

"This crazy chick should turn VH-1 on its ear." --<I> The Music Paper
</I></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Mary Ellen Bernard</B> just doesn't know how to fit in. Her debut 
recording <I><B>Point of Departure</B></I> was described by a New York radio 
personality as
"Tom Waits meets Tracey Ullman." (Huh?) See, it's not quite pop, not
quite jazz, not quite blues, not quite folk -- and yet, a little of
each. And some of it's kind of, well ... funny. What's a radio
programmer to do? Well ... play it! And they have ... at WXPN in
Philadelphia ... WGBH in Boston ... the "Z-100 Morning Zoo" in New York
city ... KSER in Seattle... even Radio Riga in Latvia! (Yes, Latvia.)
And listeners love it.<P>

On Point of Departure Mary Ellen and producer Paul Guzzone are more
musically extravagant than is currently feasible in her live shows.
Here, the Patty Larkin song "Caffeine" is a full-fledged big-band
number. Other tracks feature (live, not sampled) Brazilian percussion,
horn sections, even bird calls. (Okay, the bird calls are sampled --
with permission, of course.) "We tried desperately to use every
musician in New York," Mary Ellen says of the undertaking. "We didn't,
but you still get your money's worth."<P>

Mary Ellen has been playing live at such Northeast clubs as The Iron
Horse Music Hall in Northampton, MA; The Godfrey Daniels in Bethlehem,
PA; The Bitter End in New York city, The Towne Crier in Pawling, NY and
other folk clubs, coffee houses, jazz & blues rooms, theaters and
festivals. She's opened shows for Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, John
Sebastian and Saffire: Uppity Blues Women.<P>

Backed by keyboards and bass/acoustic guitar (and sometimes violin),
her concerts center mostly on rootsy blues and jazz, bittersweet
ballads and her signature "wacky production numbers." "Caffeine" has
become one of these and so has the John Prine/Fred Koller collaboration
"Let's Talk Dirty in Hawaiian." Recently some original tunes have
entered this category as well. "My mission is to disprove the theory
that no one ever laughs in a folk club," she states. "I'll be working
on jazz clubs next."<P>

<B>Order NOW!</B><BR>
<I><B>Point of Departure</B></I> featuring "Sugar Reef" is available on
CD and cassette. Also available is the incredibly cool Mary Ellen
Bernard T-Shirt!<P>
