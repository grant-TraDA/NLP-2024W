<HR>
<H3>From the first Monty Python's Flying Circus 
episode ever!!!</H3><HR>
<B><I></B>(A tourist approaches a shepherd.<B> </B>The sounds of sheep and the outdoors are 
heard.)<B></I><P>
Tourist: </B>Good afternoon.<P>
<B>Shepherd: </B>Eh, 'tis that.<P>
<B>Tourist: </B>You here on holiday?<P>
<B>Shepherd: </B>Nope, I live 'ere.<P>
<B>Tourist: </B>Oh, good for you. Uh...those ARE sheep aren't they?<P>
<B>Shepherd: </B>Yeh.<P>
<B>Tourist: </B>Hmm, thought they were.<B> </B>Only, what are they doing up in the trees?<P>
<B>Shepherd: </B>A fair question and one that in recent weeks 'as been much on my mind.<B> 
</B>It's my<B> </B>considered opinion that they're nestin'.<P>
<B>Tourist: </B>Nesting?<P>
<B>Shepherd: </B>Aye.<P>
<B>Tourist: </B>Like birds?<P>
<B>Shepherd: </B>Exactly.<B> </B>It's my belief that these sheep are laborin' under the 
misapprehension that<B> </B>they're birds.<B> </B>Observe their be'avior. Take for a start the 
sheeps' tendency to 'op<B> </B>about the field on their 'ind legs.<B> </B>Now witness their attmpts 
to fly from tree to<B> </B>tree.<B> </B>Notice that they do not so much fly as...plummet.<P>
<I><Baaa baaa... flap flap flap ... whoosh ... thud.></I><P>
<B>Tourist: </B>Yes, but why do they think they're birds?<P>
<B>Shepherd: </B>Another fair question.<B> </B>One thing is for sure, the sheep is not a creature 
of the air.<B> </B> They have enormous difficulty in the comparatively simple act of perchin'. 
<I><Baaa baaa... flap flap flap ... whoosh ... thud.> </I>Trouble is, sheep are very dim.<B> 
</B>Once they get an idea in their 'eads, there's no<B> </B>shiftin' it.<P>
<B>Tourist: </B>But where did they get the idea?<P>
<B>Shepherd: </B>From Harold.<B> </B>He's that most dangerous of creatures, a clever sheep. 'e's 
realized<B> </B>that a sheep's life consists of standin' around for a few months and then bein' 
eaten.<B> </B> And that's a depressing prospect for an ambitious sheep.<P>
<B>Tourist: </B>Well why don't just remove Harold?<P>
<B>Shepherd: </B>Because of the enormous commercial possibilities if 'e succeeds.<P>
