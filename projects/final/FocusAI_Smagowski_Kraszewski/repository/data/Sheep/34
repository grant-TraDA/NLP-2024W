<p><p><b>The Mongolian Felt Tent (1995)</br>Client: Asian Art Museum of San Francisco</b></p>
<p>This frame shows the amount of wool produced annually by the average Mongolian sheep. It is part of an animated information graphic which asks "How many sheep does it take to produce enough wool to cover a felt tent?" The answer is probably more than you think.</p>
