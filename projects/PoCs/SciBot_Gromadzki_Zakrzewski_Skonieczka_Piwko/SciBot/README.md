# RAG ChatBot

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot for Scientific Papers designed to assist users in navigating, summarizing, and understanding scientific literature. This tool allows users to ask complex questions about scientific content, receive precise answers, and engage with large volumes of research material more interactively and efficiently.

## Technical Stack
 
 - **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python-based web app framework for simplicity and speed). 
 - **Backend:** LangChain for modular integration with LLMs and retrieval components.
 - **LLM Serving:**: Ollama, enabling efficient model deployment and performance.

## Customization

Weâ€™ve included a Python script, `pdf2faiss.py`, which allows users to create their own vector stores and customize the chatbot to suit their specific needs.
