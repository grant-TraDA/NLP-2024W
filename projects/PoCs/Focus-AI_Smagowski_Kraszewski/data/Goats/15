<hr><H2><CENTER>Are you having trouble subscribing yo the Goat mailing list ?  Try the instructions below or click <a href="mailto:listproc@listproc.wsu.edu"> here</A></address></CENTER></H2>
</B><HR>
The listproc software is similar to the listserv software. It is very easy to master. Your subscription request 
will be sent to a computer, not to a human being. <P>
1.  Send an e-mail message to the subscription address listed (it should be "listproc@ followed by the 
listserver address). For example to subscribe to a list located at Washington State University you would type 
the following:<P>
listproc@listproc.wsu.edu<P>
2. You can leave the SUBJECT: line blank. It is ignored by listproc. <P>
3.  In the body of your message type the command: SUBSCRIBE followed by the name of the list and your  
real name (not your e-mail address). For example, if you were John Doe, you would subscribe to a list 
called GOAT-L by typing the following in the body of your e-mail:<P>
 SUBSCRIBE GOAT-L John Doe<P>
In a short time, often less than a minute, you will receive a confirmation message that you have been 
accepted.  The listproc will give you a password. You will need this if you want to process live requests.<P>
4. To post a message to the group, send an e-mail message to the name of the list followed by the listproc 
address. For example to ask a question to the GOAT-L list you would send an e-mail note to goat-l@listproc.wsu.edu.  Write a subject and body as you would for a normal e-mail message.<P>
