<body><h1>Canned Hunt Victim</h1>
<hr>
This "Spanish goat" was released from a truck into an enclosed area. A brave
hunter then cornered it and put a bullet in its flank and it died a
slow and agonizing death. A subsequent bullet to the brain to put it out
of its misery was avoided because it would have ruined the goat for
trophy purposes. A marvellous sporting event? Not!
