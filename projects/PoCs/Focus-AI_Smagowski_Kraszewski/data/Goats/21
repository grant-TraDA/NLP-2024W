<li>  We are a non-profit, all volunteer organization
who care for stray animals, everything from kittens to
goats.

<li> Thank you for all the wonderful letters that we
have received over the past year. 

We are often asked for pets, but unfortunately we do not
have the money or the legal department to properly document 
and ship animals across state lines. Sorry, we recommend you 
visit the your local SPCA  and save an animal from destruction.

<li>  Please do not send us money or any more pet food. If you 
like what we do, please join us by  saving animals in your
local community.
