<title>Animals I Have Known</title>

<H2>A pictorial tour of some of the animals <br>
(and people) in my life</h2>

These are the first scans of these images.  Soon, I'll be coming back to 
clean them up and make them a bit smaller so that all the poor people
like me who only have SLIP connections don't have to spend so long
waiting for the pictures come in.<p>

<IMG SRC="gifs/animals/kodiak.gif"><br>
I know it's just a boring, cliche`, dog picture to the rest of you
but to my brother and I, this dog had so much character I had to
put him in.  Sadly, Kodiak is no longer with us.<p>

<IMG SRC="gifs/animals/patches.gif"><br>
In this picture, we see my first dog, Patches, being very patient
with my younger brother, Jason.  Jason is the one on the right
and yes, that is a banana peel on the dog's head.<p>

<IMG SRC="gifs/animals/goat.gif"><br>
This is a goat we met in Amsterdam.  No other goats to be found.
No other animals of any kind.  We weren't on a farm; in fact, we 
were just on our way to a tulip nursery.  Apparently, goats just
roam free on the outskirts of Amsterdam.  Who says travel isn't
broadening?<p>

<IMG SRC="gifs/animals/lions.gif"><br> Of course every university
seems to have animals or statues of some sort that yell/roar/ring/etc.
when freshmen/virgins/coeds/etc.  walk by.  At 
<A HREF="http://www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a>, these are the
lions that roar when virgins go by.  Of course, to alums the most
enduring symbol of the University was the old smokestack which was
torn down the year after I graduated.  I don't have any pictures of
the smokestack so the lions will have to do in its absence.<p>

<IMG SRC="gifs/animals/sbc06.gif"><br>
I met this goose while I was working at <A HREF="http://www.anl.gov">
Argonne National Labs</a>.  Argonne is on a nature preserve and is
very picturesque.  Known more to the outside residents for its unique
herd of albino deer and to the interns for its <I>Evil and Agressive
Swans</i>, the only pictures I seem to have are of the geese.  Go
figure!<p>

People are some of my favorite animals.  The original of this photo
just might be my favorite out of all those I've ever taken.  I caught
these kids at a swim meet in Greenwood, IN.  I was coaching at the time
but during the break between the morning and afternoon sessions the 
pool was mostly deserted and I was able to take a few pics of these 
girls in natural, childlike play.<p>
