<H1>VISUAL WORK</H1><P>
<IMG SRC="initial.gif" ALT="____________________________________"><P>

The plan is for this to be a revolving gallery of my paintings and drawings, with 
occasional updates when I have produced new work that is good enough to dicker about with and get scanned in.  <P>

New! A sketchbook of black wash watercolors from a monthlong trip I took to India in December 1993. <P>

<H2>Life scenes</H2><P>

<A HREF="house.gif"><IMG SRC="housesmall.gif" ALT="house"></A>
Influenced by Edward Hopper, this depicts a beach house after a huge storm along the coast.<P>

<A HREF="gate.gif"><IMG SRC="gatesmall.gif" ALT="gate"></A>
This gate led down into a garden that I never got to go into.<P>

<A HREF="horse.gif"><IMG SRC="horsesmall.gif" ALT="horse and two goats"></A>
I did a series of paintings of the small plastic animals that I'd grown up with as a child.  My motivation for this was wanting to paint animals that cast shadows and not having the mobility to go out to a zoo.<P>

'Chinese Generals'<BR>
I painted this at the same time I was taking a course in Chinese Art History and 
learning about how the Chinese painters used animals and other images drawn from nature to express political parables.  The instructor caught my attention with a story about two Chinese generals at the time of the Mongol invasion (c. 1272).  One ended up collaborating with the invaders, the other relinquished all his titles and wealth and went up into the mountains to herd goats.  A well-known master painter illustrated this with a simple brush drawing of a sheep and a goat, the animals symbolizing the respective spirits of these generals.  I painted a lot of bad paintings of sheep and goats before I managed to get this one good one.  Whether or not it ended up being anything about Chinese generals is another story....<P>

<H2>Fantasy Images</H2><P>

<A HREF="rider.gif"><IMG SRC="ridersmall.gif" ALT="rider"></A>
This was my Christmas card one year when I was still stubborn enough to try to color cards up for all my friends.<P>

<A HREF="street.gif"><IMG SRC="streetsmall.gif" ALT="street scene"></A>
The inspiration for this was an Italian hill town, but I think it does suggest stepping into a far off city in a fantastic world.<P>

<A HREF="lovers.gif"><IMG SRC="loversmall.gif" ALT="tarot cards"></A>
This is my King and Queen of Cups.  The poses are nicked from the card that 
symbolizes 'The Lovers' in the fifteenth century Visconti Tarot deck.  She carries the magic cup that wells up with its own source of water; He carries the magic cup that is the stuff of the seas--when he ruffles the water within the cup, a storm appears upon the seas...
