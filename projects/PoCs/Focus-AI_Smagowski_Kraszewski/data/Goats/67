<h2>Pulp Fiction</H2>

<H3>May 21st</h3>

Took it easy today. Went to the video store and picked up Pulp Fiction to watch later that evening! <p>

On the way into Liverpool 3 weeks ago I noticed a pub called The Goat. With such a stupid name, me and Mike decided now would be a good time to check it out. Well, did we get a shock! What a load of shit! The shittiest tiny little pub I've seen so far in England! Still, I had to get a photo outside it, and that we did! Trying not to laugh too much! ;-) Oh well, I guess there's probably hundreds more pubs like it all over the country!<p>

Mike hadn't seen Pulp Fiction, so we sat down to watch it that night. It's a kick-ass film, no matter how many times you've seen it! I love it! And Mike is now a Tarantino fan too! ;-)<p>
