<h1>Puzzler Page Answers</h1>

The solution to the puzzler "It's about Time" is that Tim leaves work at 
4:24 p.m.<P>

In the "Seat Yourself" puzzler, Brett and Rett are seated in row 14.<P>

In the oldie "Crossing the River" the solution is to:<br>
1) take the goat over and come back alone<BR>
2) take the wolf over and bring the goat back<BR>
3) take the cabbage over and come back alone<BR>
4) take the goat over<br>
(with thanks to Sam Barer for the concise answer).<P>

Let's go back to the <a href="puzzler.html">Puzzler Page</a> and try 
something new.<P>
