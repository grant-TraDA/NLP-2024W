INTRODUCTION
<P>
PREFACE
<P>
The earliest recorded arrival of goats in Australia was with the
First Fleet in 1788. Goats are exceptionally hardy animals able
to survive and reproduce on poor quality feed and limited water.
These very traits that made goats indispensable to the early settlers
are the qualities that now make the feral goat an environmental
menace.
<P>
The versatile, easily handled, domesticated goat accompanied the
pioneers, the miners and the railway gangs to wide areas of Australia.
The goat was a ready source of milk and meat and in some places
goats were used for light haulage and racing. An early mohair
industry added to introductions in Victoria and Western Australia.
As the country developed the settlers turned to cows for milk,
and sheep and cattle for meat. The wool industry rapidly supplanted
the early mohair industry. Unwanted goats were often set free
or escaped to form the basis of today's feral herds.
<P>
This bibliography covers the broad subject of feral goats in Australia.
Material listed is from a variety of sources: monographs, journals,
conference proceedings, working papers, newspaper reports. It
includes history, distribution, control methods, diseases, exploitation
for meat, fibre and hides and the environmental impact of feral
goats. Research programs on biological behaviour and production
potential are included. Newspaper articles report on the emotional
response of the general public to feral goats and on the efforts
of agricultural extension workers.
<P>
Through the bibliography the changing attitudes towards feral
goats and care for the environment can be traced. During the 1960s
the approach to goat control in some areas was by poisoning watering
holes with arsenic, whereas the 1990s approach is towards the
development of an effective strategic management plan integrated
with ecologically sustainable land management. The different attitudes
of pastoralists and conservationists are highlighted. The pastoralists
despise the goat because it competes for grazing with domestic
sheep and cattle while acknowledging that in times of drought
they make more money from killing feral goats for the meat trade
than from sheep or cattle. The conservationists are concerned
with the goat's role in destruction of native flora, competition
with native fauna and erosion of the land.
<P>
In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in feral
goats as a source of cashmere, as the base stock for upgrading
Angora flocks, and as a source of meat for the export trade. These
developments are all reflected by the material listed in this
bibliography.
<P>
LEVEL
<P>
This bibliography aims to provide information of use to a variety
of groups with varying levels of interest in feral goat control
and/or exploitation. It provides references for professional officers
working with feral animal control programs, biological behaviour
and disease control programs. Material is listed of importance
to the pastoral community interested in exploiting feral goats
for meat, fibre and weed control. Conservationists are provided
with references on environmental impact.
<P>
LIMITATIONS
<P>
The bibliography was limited to material published in English
about feral goats in Australia. There was no set chronological
period covered. Miscellaneous fact sheets published by State Departments
of Agriculture, and some Western Australia and South Australian
minor magazines containing references to feral goats were not
readily available in Canberra and are not included in the bibliography.
<P>
ARRANGEMENT
<P>
Arrangement of the bibliography is under broad subject headings
to make it relatively easy to find an area of interest. Secondary
arrangement is chronological by date of publication. Ascending
order of publication emphasises the historical attitudinal changes
to feral goats and environmental management. Newspaper and hobby-farmer
magazine articles are listed under the one heading. Items giving
a general overview on many different aspects of feral goats are
listed together.

  &quot;In belah/rosewood woodland in western New South Wales
stocking with feral goats over a four year period effected changes
in the composition of tree and shrub component. The most readily
browsed tree was rosewood and mature trees of this species were
stripped of foliage to a height of 2m. At an early stage desert
broombush (Templetonia egena) and young warrior bush (Apophyllum
anomalum) were severely damaged and young yarran (Acacia homalophylla)
an belah defoliated. Most defoliated yarran died with in the observation
period. Two shrubs regarded as weed species punty bush (Cassia
eremophila var. platypoda) and desert cassia (Cassia eremophila
var. coriacea) were heavily browsed in the third year and subsequently
eliminated. The weed shrub turpentine (Eremophila sturtii) was
not browsed at any time.&quot;

 Author's abstract:
<P>
  &quot;The conflicting but informative literature relating to
goats on Lord Howe Island is reviewed. Observations made in 1970-72
indicate that the effects of goats are localised. Invasion of
goat camps by naturalised plants is widespread. Changes attributable
to goats are discussed in detail. The effects of goats and pigs
are compared. Goats occupy a different but overlapping habitats
from pigs. A total of 228 was shot in an extermination program.
Overall density 0.17/ha varies. Rumen content analysis indicates
goats are both selective and individualistic feeders. Naturalized
plants are eaten in the same proportion as they occur in the flora.
The relationship between naturalized weeds and goats appear to
be commensal.&quot;

<P>
  &quot;Diet of feral goats was recorded by direct observation
in a shrub-dominated Eucalyptus populnea woodland in New South
Wales on 7 sampling occasions during 2 years. Different nutritional
opportunities were provided by the effects of rainfall on 4 contrasting
grazing treatments. The goats foraged evenly over the paddocks
and encountered most foods with the same frequency as they occurred.
With unlimited quantities of forage available the goats spent
63% of their time grazing and only 28% browsing. Most browsing
took place in dry conditions when pasture quality was low. When
forage was in short supply the goats accepted some shrubs not
normally eaten, and these plants died; other woody plants were
eaten erratically or not at all. Acacia aneura was the only woody
plant which was palatable and resilient to goat browsing. Goats
mostly ate the same plant species as sheep and with the same preference,
but tended to eat more browse than sheep in dry times. The browse
consumed was principally the same as that consumed by sheep, demonstrating
sequential competition for dry-season fodder. Goats demonstrated
a potential for overgrazing in dry times, indicating that stocking
rates must be adjusted at such times to avoid pastures becoming
extinct.&quot;

 Author's abstract:
<P>
  &quot;Measurements indexing the mating system, home range, peri-parturient
behaviour, and group size and composition of feral goats were
used to compare studied populations. Geographically diverse populations
were similar in most behavioural characteristics and their social
systems had similar structures. However, post-partum behaviour
and mating systems showed both quantitative and qualitative differences
between populations. These similarities and differences are discussed
in relation to the diverse selection history of feral goats. It
is postulated that selective changes occurring during domestication
may contribute to the variability observed in post-partum behaviour
and mating systems.&quot;

 Author's abstract:
<P>
  &quot;Home range of feral goats studied by radio-telemetry in
a pastoral area in Western Australia were much larger than those
found in most other studies. Home ranges of males were larger
(ranging from 139.2 to 587.7 sqkm) than those of females, which
ranged from 15.0 to 190.2sqkm. Excursions outside the normal (90
percentile) home ranges were common. The home ranges of females
were smaller during summer than winter. Male home ranges were
of similar size in both seasons. Group structure and composition
was highly variable. Implications of goat movements on management
and control programmes are discussed.&quot;

pp. 385-386.
<P>
 Presents results of a survey of 900 feral goats processed through
an export abattoir in Western Australia demonstrating 3.1% of
goats had caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) lesions in lymph nodes or
organs while 13.7% had positive antibody titres. Survey was conducted
to correlate prevalence of CLA in W. A. feral goats with that
encountered in surveys in Queensland, New South Wales and South
Australia. Discusses lesions, sites of lesions, bacteria involved,
reasons for discrepancy between presence of lesions and positive
antibody titres. Notes post mortem inspection did not include
head and neck. Refers to reports of high incidence of head and
neck lesions in domestic goats. Concludes true prevalence of CLA
in feral goats in all states is likely to be higher than reported
as routine post mortem inspections have not included lymph nodes
of head and neck. Suggests future surveys include examination
of entire carcase.

<P>
 With prices for feral goats exceeding prices for sheep; goats
are no longer seen as vermin but as an important alternative income
source for pastoralists in semi-arid and arid areas of Western
Australia. This study examines the distribution and prevalence
of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) and considers the significance
of feral goats as a potential source of infection for sheep or
goats. Results showed that of 2920 feral goats slaughtered at
a Perth abattoir in 1984, 7.8% had lesions of CLA. Of the affected
goats, 49.3% had head, 46.7% body and 12.3% visceral lesions.
Results were compared with previously reported data from sheep
and significant differences are discussed. Head lesions were common
in goats but absent in sheep; lung lesions were less common in
goats than sheep; carcase lesions was similar in both species
while multiple lesions were less common in goats than in sheep.

 Author's summary:
<P>
  &quot;Caseous lymphadenitis was the most frequently encountered
pathological condition in 3,720 feral goats examined during routine
meat inspection procedures. Among nine separate consignments of
animals the prevalence of infection averaged 7.4% (range 0.3%-18.8%).
The majority of lesions were seen in lymph modes draining superficial
body areas although many also occurred in internal modes and organs.
Corynebacterium ovis was isolated from 25 of 32 lesions submitted
for bacteriological examination. Other conditions regularly encountered
included pneumonia, cysticercosis, sarcosporidiosis and lice infestation,
while myonecrosis, pleurisy, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis,
cirrhosis and mite infestation were only occasionally found. A
total of 171 serum samples were collected and tested against 17
antigens. Samples from 57.9% and 51.5% showed positive serological
reactions to the antigens for sarcosporidiosis and Q fever respectively.&quot;

of Australian feral goats for economic cashmere production is
limited, and considers the use of the Angora to improve the performance
of feral goats. The present breeding policy of the Australian

  &quot;A scheme developed to encourage landowners to develop
goat enterprises has been successful in demonstrating that goats
can be used to open up heavily scrub infested rangelands in the
Cobar region, and give a reasonable financial return on the investment
required in special fencing to confine them. The areas selected
were dominated by scrub species acceptable to goats: 2 species
in particular, narrow leaved hopbush (Dodonea [Dodonaea] attenuata)
and the juvenile form of mulga (Acacia aneura), occur at spacings
of 2-5 m, with mulga thickets often occupying large areas. These
areas occur widely in shrub invaded poplar box (Eucalyptus populnea)/Acacia
woodland across N. and W. New South Wales. Fencing and management
of feral goats to encourage the return of grass and herbage species,
and a continuing supply of young mulga browse, are described.
Goats can be selected for cashmere, and the breeding of a dual
purpose meat/cashmere goat is envisaged.&quot;

  &quot;Fleece samples were taken from several body sites of 23
feral goats. The samples were dehaired, and measurements made
of down diameter and its distribution. These were compared with
measurements made on composite samples drawn from the total fleece
of each animal. Samples taken from the hip gave the most accurate
estimate of down diameter of fleeces of av. diameter, but midside
samples were better over the range of diameters exhibited by these
goats. None of the sites was very suitable for estimating the
diameter of extreme fibres, or the fibre diameter distribution.
The repeatabilities of the various measurements were generally
high. Production measurements recorded in 2yr from 20 of these
goats show that diameter, yield and weight of down had high repeatabilities,
but diameter distribution and length of down were not repeatable
over years.&quot;

<P>
 Author's abstract:
<P>
  &quot;The density of feral goats in about 234sqkm of arid rangeland
used for sheep grazing in South Australia was estimated by means
of a mark-resight technique. Marking and subsequent resighting
were done at watering points. The Petersen estimate was 4.4 goats
per square kilometre; adjustment to allow for non-random behaviour
raised this estimate to 5.0/sqkm. Maximum allowable sheep density
is 12/sqkm. The goat density we observed imposes an added burden
on the vegetation. The densities of red and western grey kangaroos,
when added together, approximate that of goats. Rabbits are virtually
absent. The long-term effects of the total grazing pressure on
the vegetation cannot be predicted in detail but will probably
be deleterious.&quot;
