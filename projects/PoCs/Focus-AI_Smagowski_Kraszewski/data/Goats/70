If you've read this far you are no doubt a coffee person. As such, you are certainly aware of the coffee discovery legend. To review: A few hundred years ago some African goatherders saw their goats cavorting with unusual great enthusiasm. Investigating, the goatherders traced the behavior to the coffee cherries the goats were eating. From this they learned to make a new beverage called kaffe.
<P> This is a lame story. Africa has been inhabited for thousands of centuries and just twenty generations ago people discovered coffee? Because for the first time goats decided to eat coffee beans? It's hincky! There is strong evidence to suggest that coffee is a new arrival on planet earth. It was brought here to wake people up. Soon after coffee was "discovered" coffee houses sprang up in Europe and in no time there was revolution. Freedom was in the air. Or more to the point, in the cup. Experience the

 original wild coffees from Ethiopia. And you too will wake up.
