She is coming.<br>
<IMG SRC="pixelclear.gif" width=15 height=20> 

I can feel her. I can smell her.<br>
<IMG SRC="pixelclear.gif" width=15 height=20> 

I can almost <I>taste</I> her.<br>

The goats sense her, too. They're watching me nervously, walking around in
small circles, never straying too far out of my sight. My slightest movement
sends them into a panic. Even my songs barely calm them.<br>

My keepers are planning something special, they tell me cryptically.
Although they have lied to me in the past, I know this time they're for real.
The goats know. The moon knows.<br>

I raise the pipes to my lips, and practice the song I've written for her, the
song I've been waiting to play for centuries.<br>

Clouds pass in front of the moon. A he-goat mounts a she-goat and humps her
furiously.<br> <IMG SRC="pixelclear.gif" width=15 height=20> 

Perfect.<br>
