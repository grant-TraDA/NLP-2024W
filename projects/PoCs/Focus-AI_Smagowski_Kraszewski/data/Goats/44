Welcome to the Cygnus Animal Preserve!  Cygnus animals, past, present,
and future are electronically represented here. <p>

<h2>Cats</h2>

<a href="/staff/gif/pati.gif">Pati</a> and her husband
Pete have two cats, <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~pati/bogart.gif">Bogart</a> 
and <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~pati/frodo.gif">Frodo</a>.  Bogart 
is the troublemaker of the two.

<p>
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs">Stan</a> and Natalie have two cats,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs/mackey.tiff">Mackey</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs/velcro.tiff">Velcro</a>
.
Mackey's name derives from the Mac the Knife
(he was named by Natalie's daughter when she was young),
while Velcro is notable for his clinginess.
Eventually we'll add an illustration of this...
At 14 and 18 pounds, Mackey and Velcro are both lapfuls!

<p>
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn">Dawn</a> has 3 happy
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/kitties.gif">fur balls</a>
named Tiger, Slinky and Zipidie.  Tigers are wonderful things,
Slinky thinks she's a spring, and Zipidie isn't so zippy now 
that he's a whopping 18 pounds.<p>
.

<h2>Dogs</h2>

<a href="http://www.base.com/gordoni/gordoni.html">Gordon's</a>
roommate's dog, <a
href="http://www.base.com/roque/roque.html">Roque</a>, is in charge of
system security at <a href="http://www.base.com/">base.com</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/juno.jpg">Juno</a>, the world's
most spastic canine, can leap tall fences in a single bound, 
chase cars with the grace of a penguin, 
shatter glass with a single bark,
and coat an entire arm with slobber in a single lick.
If anyone dared enter his 
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn">master</a>
's territory, they'd be loved to death in seconds. <p>

<h2>Goats</h2>

<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~ian">Ian</a>'s parents run a cashmere
goat farm.  Here is a picture of 
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~ian/lady.gif">Lady</a>, a doe imported from
Australia, and two of her kids.  There are more goat pictures at the <a
href="http://www.cygnus.com/~ian/black-locust-farm.html">Black Locust
Farm</a> home page.<p>

<h2>Pigs</h2>

<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/piggio.gif">Piggio</a> is
a very happy pink pot pellied pig. 
After a not terribly successful career as company mascot at 3DO,
he hopes to change his name to Pignus and become Cygnus' new garbage
disposal, in spite of the more popular notion that the job might be 
better served by a goat.
He's had some very interesting adventures and has his very own 
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/piggio.html">web page</a>
to tell you all about it.<p>

<h2>Birds</h2>

Cygnus' animal preserve wouldn't be complete without a bird sanctuary,
and in fact, you'll find one in
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn">Dawn</a>'s house.  
At last count, there were 7 feathered squawkers and 10 more cooking in the nest.
And well, you know what they say about big birds, "they make big poos".
Here are some of their pictures if you'd like to meet some of them:<p>

<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/cookie.gif">Cookie</a>, the scary cookatoo,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/happy.gif">Happy</a>, the lonely cockatiel,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/cirrus_n_tinsel.gif">Cirrus and Tinsel</a>, are two parakeets with half a brain each,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/yin.gif">Yin</a>, the lovebird who hates everyone,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/albinos.gif">Casper and Snowwhite</a>, the albino cockatiels whose
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/eggs.gif">eggs</a> won't hatch, and
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/phoenix.gif">Phoenix</a>, the jeolous conure.<p>

<h2>Fish</h2>

<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs">Stan</a> and Natalie also
have a number of koi and goldfish in their outdoor pond.  In the
summer, they like to come up to the surface and suck on your
fingers.
Perhaps someday we'll get a picture of the heron that has eaten several
of our fish.  We usually keep a net over the pond to prevent any more
such tragic events.<p>

<h2>Everything Else</h2>

<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/herman.gif">Herman</a> lives in a
shell.
He's very quiet, doesn't eat much, and doesn't get around too much.
We often wonder if he's still alive.<p>
