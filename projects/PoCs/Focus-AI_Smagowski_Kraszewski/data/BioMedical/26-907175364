<H3>Not so rare</H3><p>

"Our son was misdiagnosed for more than two years.  You cannot imagine the nightmare we lived through.  The professionals we saw could not identify his illness.  We spent huge sums of money searching for an answer.  When his disorder was finally diagnosed, we learned that it was so rare, physicians knew little about it.  There seems to be no treatment, and very little research giving us hope for his future."<p>
Although this parent thought her story was unique, millions of Americans with rare disorders have suffered similar agonies.  Names of their illnesses may be different, but most have experienced the indignity of searching for help in vain.  Rare disorders are "back of the textbook" illnesses, unfamiliar to the general public and professionals alike.  They can strike people of all ages, all races, and all ethnic backgrounds.  Many are genetic; others are acquired through environmental causes. But for most, the cause is still unknown.  Thus, even after a family obtains a proper diagnosis, they are too often left with more unanswerable questions.<p>
