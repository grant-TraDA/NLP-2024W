<H1>WELCOME TO THE KUNTZ GROUP!</H1> 
<HR>
<P>
The Kuntz lab consists of two groups: a "dockers" group, which is
working on issues in structure-based drug design, and an NMR group.<p>
The main focus of the dockers group is the development of tools for the
discovery of lead compounds once the 3D structure of a target receptor
is known.  Our best known tool is the program <a
href="http://www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/kuntz/dock.html">DOCK</a>, which searches
databases of chemical structures for potential lead compounds for a
particular receptor.  We've also been developing  BUILDER, for design
of novel compounds to interact with particular receptor, and are
experimenting with QSAR applications of DOCK.<p>
