<h1>MycDB, the Mycobacterium database - release 3-8</h1>

<hr>
<B>MycDB</B>, the <B>Myc</B>obacterium <B>D</B>ata<B>B</B>ase, uses the excellent database
manager <A HREF="http://probe.nalusda.gov:8000/acedocs/acedbfaq.html">ACEDB</A>,
 written by Richard Durbin (Sanger Centre, Cambridge, UK) and Jean Thierry-Mieg
(CNRS, Montpellier, France). MycDB is funded by the WHO and the Fondation Raoul
Follereau and is maintained by the Unite de Genetique Moleculaire
Bacterienne at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and the Department of
Biochemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The
latest public release, 3-8, is described <A HREF="MycDB/MycDB.LatestVersion.html">here</A>.
<hr>

<B>MycDB</B> is also available (through the good offices of the Genome Informatics Group
at the National Agricultural Library) on the <A
HREF="http://probe.nalusda.gov:8300/other/index.html">Agricultural Genome
Information Server, AGIS</A>, in Beltsville, Maryland, USA. If you are located
in the Americas, that site may be faster.<P>

The database is described in a paper:<PRE>
  Staffan Bergh and Stewart T. Cole
  MycDB: an integrated mycobacterial database
  Mol. Microbiol. <B>5</B> (1994) 517-534</PRE>
that we ask you to cite if you publish anything that draws on the database.

<H2>Getting your own</H2>
The database manager software and the database itself are both free, and you
can install a copy of your own on your home computer. In the <A
HREF="MycDB/MycDB.LatestVersion.html"><B>Announcement</B></A> of the latest
release there are links to <A HREF="MycDB/MycDB.Retrieval.html">installation
instructions</A> and to the files you need to get. <P>

There is a also <A
HREF="http://www.biochem.kth.se/MycDB/MycDB_pres.html">presentation</A>
of MycDB that shows some of the features of the X-windows version that
you may want to have a look at.

If you have problems, or suggestions, or find errors or want to share your data, do not hesitate to contact <A

<H2>Queries</H2>

<B>NOTE</B> that this is an experimental server! We try to keep it functional, but do not guarantee that it will always work. <br>

To consult MycDB, you can:

<ul>

<li> query directly, if you know the syntax of <I>tace</I>
commands. Just <a
href="http://www.biochem.kth.se/cgi-bin/nph-runmycdb.sh/acedb/MycDB?">select
this</a> and enter your query in the "Enter search keywords" window at
the top. (The syntax of <I>tace</I> commands and the query language
are described in the <a
href="http://www.biochem.kth.se/cgi-bin/nph-runmycdb.sh/acedb/MycDB?h">Help
File</a>.)

<li> look at the <a
href="http://www.biochem.kth.se/cgi-bin/nph-runmycdb.sh/acedb/MycDB?c">'Main window'</a> of the database

<li> use the <a
href="http://www.biochem.kth.se/cgi-bin/nph-runmycdb.sh/acedb/MycDB?p">Query
Builder/Query by examples</a> functions <I>(these are still
experimental)</I> to construct your query. You must have a Web client
which recognizes the &lt;FORM&gt; tag to use it (i.e. NetScape, Mosaic
for X, MacMosaic, MacWeb or Lynx).

<LI> <B>NEW!</B> <A HREF="http://www.biochem.kth.se/MycDB/seqsearch_form.html">Search MycDB</A> with your own sequence.
