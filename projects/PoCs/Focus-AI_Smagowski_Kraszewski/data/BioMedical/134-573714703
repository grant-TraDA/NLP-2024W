<p>
The graduate program in Pharmaceutical Chemistry
represents one of the largest academic research centers
concerned with drug discovery, development, and application.
The goal of the program is to continue to set the standard
for excellence in education and research in pharmaceutical chemistry
and experimental therapeutics.
Research groups in the program apply
physical, chemical, biological, pharmacological,
and toxicological principles to the
design, delivery, and application of drugs
and biomolecules, leading to novel therapies.
The research areas represent thematic programs
based on common research interests among various groups of the faculty.
