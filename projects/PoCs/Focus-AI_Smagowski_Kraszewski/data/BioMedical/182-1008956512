<h3>HealthNet to GO!</h3>

HealthNet to GO! is an exercise to optimize currently available Internet
tools for the health community. It consists of a number of different
packages which can be easily installed and allow the health Internet user
to easily access a number of different health related sites.

<i><b>Important !!! Disclaimer</b></i>:  HealthNet to GO! is <b>NOT</b> a
commercial product, is <b>NOT</b> for resale purposes, is <b>NOT</b>
supported and we take <b>NO</b> responsiblity for any problems it may
cause.  It is a reconfiguration of different currently available Internet
software to "point" to health related content around the Internet. 
HealthNet to GO! and the related projects with the goal of enabling users
to make better use of the content that is currently available to them. <p>

It is currently available for Windows 3.1x formats and assumes that the
user either has access to SLIP (or SLIP like access - through something
like <a href="http://marketplace.com">TIA</a>), or a direct connection via
a LAN and is thus capable of using Windows 3.1x interfaces to access the Internet.

pointers that new health users on the Internet will be able to start using
Internet to be able to assist them in their work. <p>
