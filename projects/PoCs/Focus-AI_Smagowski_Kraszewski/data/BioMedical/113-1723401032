  <LI><B>NEW!</b>There is a <A HREF="./other/cchs.html">support group</a> 
      for families of children suffering from Congenital Central

  <LI>Anyone want to volunteer to help with the FAQ?  I can't write the

This site is relatively new and still under construction.  There is not as
much here now as I would like.  I'm counting on you, the visitors, to help
change that.  So, please, if you have any...<A
HREF="mailto:faust@access.digex.net">send me information.</a> I'm looking
for whatever can be sent electronically (or even via snail-mail).  If you
have informational files, papers, names, addresses, manufacturer info,
sleep center info, articles - <I>whatever</i>! If you think it might be of
any interest at all to OSA sufferers, please send it.  If you have
comments or suggestions, send them, too - but no guarantees as to when
they will appear; I only have so many hours in the day.<P>

SNORE is intended to be a repository for information about <A
HREF="./osa/osa.html">Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)</a>.  Some
information is also included about other sleep disorders, but I have
chosen to concentrate on the one which concerns me most closely.  If you
have something to contribute on OSA, in any format, send it along and I'll
format it and put it up here if I think it is of value.  If you have
information about other disorders, you can also send that, but it must be
pre-formatted (in HTML) and ready to go. </p>

<P>
A great resource for information about other sleep disorders is 
<A HREF="http://www.cloud9.net/~thorpy/">Dr. Michael Thorpy's home 
page</a>, which contains links to sleep-related resources of all kinds.</p>
