<DD>Welcome to the BITMed Simulation Server at the University of
California, San Diego.  This server is unique in that the WWW hypertext
is interleafed with true complex systems simulations of biological, chemical and
physical systems.  We are presently building several virtual environments
for the rational design of clinical trials and wetlab experiments.
Our current simulators are invaluable tools for the teaching of neuroimmunology
and HIV-induced disease to students at both the highschool and university
levels.  We also support a number of
