<B>Center Description</B><BR>
The Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford was established in 1990 to create links between academic, research, and administrative computing activities in the <A HREF="http://med-www.stanford.edu/MedCenter/MedSchool/medschool.html">Stanford University School of Medicine</A>, and to serve as a source of advice to the Deans office on <A HREF="whatisinformatics.html">informatics</A> issues. The Center was then funded in 1992 by the <A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/">National Library of Medicine (NLM)</A> to create a shared computing resource to support research activities in biomedical informatics. This resource is also named CAMIS and supports an active core research program, the computing infrastructure and day-to-day computing needs of a large number of researchers, each of whom has external support from <A HREF="http://www.nih.gov/">NIH (the National Institutes of Health)</A> or other agencies through grants or contracts. Though the CAMIS resource is <A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu">Stanford</A>-based, its mission has a national character, which includes support of national electronic mail distribution lists, extensive on-line information resources, an annual CAMIS symposium, three academic training programs, a visiting scholar program and a national advisory council. The nominal location of CAMIS is in the <A HREF="http://www-camis.stanford.edu/maps/map_msob.html">Medical School Office Building (MSOB)</A> on the <A HREF="http://www-pcd.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/map/map.html?msob">Stanford University campus</A>.
