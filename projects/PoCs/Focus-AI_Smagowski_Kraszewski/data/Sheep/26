<B><P>When the first white men visited Yellowstone in the early nineteenth century, a group of reclusive Shoshone-speaking Indians known as the Sheepeaters inhabited the Plateau.  They had neither guns nor horses and lived a stone-age lifestyle, hunting the Rocky Mountain Bighorn sheep for food and clothing.  Modern Archeology and Anthropology along with first-hand accounts of trappers and explorers help to tell the story of The Sheepeaters: Keepers of the Past.</P>	<P>This is a video for people of all ages that reveals the story of prehistoric Indians living in Yellowstone before it became the world's first National Park.  Vivid illustrations by Delores Dinsmore and authoritative narration by Dr. Les Davis of the Museum of the Rockies bring alive the story of these Native Americans.</P></B><BR><center><P>ETV-001 - (VHS) 30 minutes, $29.95</P><HR><A HREF="order.html"><IMG SRC="order.gif"WIDTH=105 HEIGHT=38></A><IMG hspace=8 vspace=0 SRC="dot_clear.gif"><A HREF="welcome.html"><IMG SRC="home.gif"WIDTH=105 HEIGHT=38></A><HR><ADDRESS>Earthtalk Studios <A HREF="mailto:Etalk@aol.com">Etalk@aol.com</A></ADDRESS></center>
