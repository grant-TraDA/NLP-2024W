<ADDRESS>
. . . . . Ovis canadensis mexicana
</ADDRESS>

<HR>

<H5>SIZE: Length of adult ram, 50 inches; weight, 200 lbs. </H5>

<H5>RANGE: Western and southern Arizona; Chihuahua and Sonora
Mexico. </H5>

<H5>HABITAT: Rocky ridges and buttes. </H5>

<H5>DIET: Herbivore; grasses, herbs, shrubs, cactus and cactus
fruit. </H5>

<H5>LIFE SPAN: 15 - 20 years. </H5>

<H5>STATUS: Once protected because of loss of habitat from human
invasion and competition with domestic and exotic animals. Population
now increasing and being reintroduced into former ranges.</H5>

<HR>

<H5>ADAPTATIONS: </H5>

<UL>
<LI>ANATOMY: Both sexes have horns. The female's horns are slimmer
and shorter than the massive curled horns of the ram.
<LI>SENSES: Good peripheral and depth vision allows it to move
over mountainsides without falling, and to maintain allaround
surveillance of the area.
<LI>LOCOMOTION: The outer edge of the hoof is hard and enables
the sheep to stand on the tiniest projection. The sole is soft
and rubberlike, which helps it to cling to smooth surfaces and
cushion the impact when jumping.
<LI>HABITS: The ram uses his horns in fighting for breeding rights.
Horns may also be used to obtain food and as a defense against
predators.
<LI>DEFENSE: Escapes into inaccessible rocky areas and fights
with horns as weapon.
<LI>SOCIAL UNIT: Males live in separate herds from the females
and the last year's young. At the start of the breeding season,
the males fight for harems, and then, with their females, separate
into new herds until that season is over.
<LI>MISC.: The Desert Bighorn can go without drinking water for
extended periods. It relies on the moisture in vegetation, especially
cactus.
