This book provides a readable account of the biological basis of the behaviour 
of sheep and of the relevance of this to the current practice of sheep 
production throughout the world. The focus is on issues central to animal 
production: feeding; social behaviour and organisation; reproductive behaviour; 
maternal behaviour; and behaviour of the lamb.<p>
The book will interest 
farmers, graziers, extension officers, students of agriculture and animal 
behaviour, as well as all concerned with sheep production. <p>
