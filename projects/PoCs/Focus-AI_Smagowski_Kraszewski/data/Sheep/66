<H1>Police Halt Sheep Load Bound for Shoreham</H1>
<hr>
From <i>The News</i>, Portsmouth, England, April 28, 1995.
<p>
<i>Protesters hail intervention near Brighton a victory.</i>
<hr>
Police stopped a lorry carrying live animal exports bound for Shoreham
Harbour today and ordered the driver not to try to reach the port.
<p>
It was the first lorry to be halted following the decision by Sussex Police
to limit police escorts for exporters.
<p>
As hundreds of protesters gathered at the port today, a lorry from 
Cheltenham carrying sheep was halted six miles away near Brighton.
<p>
The shippers, International Traders Ferries, are believed to have sent the
lorry to test the resolve of the police.
<p>
ITF's director Bill Ford was with the lorry as it was pulled over by Chief
Inspector Kelly McCartney and the driver warned not to continue.
<p>
A video cameraman, believed to be with ITF, filmed the incident while a
Ministry of Agriculture vet inspected the 176 sheep and passed them fit.
<p>
A spokesman for the lorry owners, G G Gilder, of Cheltenham, Gloucs. said
the load was bound for Shoreham.
<p>
He said in Cheltenham "I will be extremely annoyed if one of my lorries 
which is roadworthy and fully insured has been stopped on the Queen's 
highway for whatever reason."
<P>
Demonstrators at the port hailed the latest incident in the four-month 
battle to halt animal shipments to France as a triumph.
<p>
One said: "We are absolutely delighted. I have never believed the police 
were in favour of this kind of thing."
<p>
Sussex Chief Constable Paul Whitehouse announced recently that his officers
would only provide escorts for exporters delivering to Shoreham for two days
each week.
