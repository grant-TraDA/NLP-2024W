&gt; 	People are neither wolves nor sheep, but they are apperently rigid,
&gt; intolerant and close minded. This kind of presumtion is both foolish and 
&gt; dangerous. The world is a complex place, and while making analogies offers
&gt; a tool to simplify it, it also simplifies it. Too often these sorts of
&gt; debates fall victim to sophmoric logical faults, most commonly those 
&gt; associated with ambiguity &amp; equivocation. As well it seems the argumentative
&gt; fallacies seem especialy prone to abuse, particularly Argumentum ad Hominem &amp;
&gt; &amp; False Cause fallacies.

lots of pretentious crap deleted

&gt; The world IS a complex place. False arguments on the net DO waste
&gt; bandwith.

It's all very well proposing that we all give thoroughly rigorous arguments, but
as you say, most of us do not have a classical education. Therefore I suggest
you dont waste bandwidth with the dictionary that you swallowed, or waste our time
having to read this verbose twaddle.
