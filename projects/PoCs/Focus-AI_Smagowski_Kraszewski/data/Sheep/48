Sponsored by the <A HREF="cgs-home.htm">Colorado Genealogical Society</A>.
<PRE> </PRE>
The Colorado Genealogical Society invites you to compete for its Black
Sheep Award for Writing Excellence. Our purpose is to provide an
opportunity for you to apply your writing and documenting skills to
"black sheep" genealogical subject matter. We seek originality in
choice, treatment, and presentation of subject matter as well as the
achievement of excellence in writing and documentation.
<PRE> </PRE><BR>
Your choice of subject is important. Black Sheep is defined as "a
person considered undesirable or disgraceful by his family or group."
Your subject need not be related to your family. All subjects in your
paper must have died prior to 1930. Here are some examples of topics:
genealogy of the ownership of a bordello which made your
city/family/state notorious; a wild and woolly ancestor of yours, of a
friend, or of no one you know; an unusual past owner of the house you
live in; an introduction to a compilation of the infamous such as to
an index of markers in a "boot hill cemetery" or a jail (the
compilation need not be a part of the entry); a religious heretic, or
a devout Christian in a family of heretics.
<PRE> </PRE><BR>
Entries will be judged on such criteria as: originality in choice and
treatment of subject matter; writing style (technique and approach
in presenting subject); depth of research; evaluation of evidence;
quality of source material used to document evidence; and writing
mechanics (form, grammar, punctuation, spelling, documentation).
<PRE> </PRE><BR>
The Black Sheep Award for Writing Excellence will be presented for
overall superior quality in written presentation. In addition,
citations for excellence may be awarded for special recognition of
originality, writing style, documentation, or technique.</P>
