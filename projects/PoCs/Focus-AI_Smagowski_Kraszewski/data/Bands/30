We are <B>"The Angels of Venice,"</B> a trio of professional female musicians
performing original music for harp, flute and cello in the
romantic/neoclassical style.  Dressed completely in white, we have been
told our appearance is as striking as the beauty and feeling our music
imparts to our listeners.
<P>
We specialize in creating an enchanting atmosphere for special
occasions, from small private parties to weddings to large media and
world events, of which we have extensive experience.
<P>
We have had the collective experience of playing in symphonies and
doing session work for movie studios, to performing at the World
Cup-sponsored "Three Tenors" concert at Dodger Stadium. We were just
recently invited to play at The Screen Actors Guild Awards Ceremony
Dinner. Our cellist participated in Yanni's "World Tour 1995"
performing in countries around the world. Members of our prior
audiences include Tom Hanks, Bob Hope, Phyllis Diller, Ann-Margaret,
Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Guns 'N Roses, and many others.
<P>
Our music evokes happiness and pure joy as well as introspection,
self-reflection and contemplation of one's inner spiritual world. Our
credo is:
<P>
