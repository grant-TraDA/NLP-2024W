<h1><b>AL REINGOLD</b></h1> <p>

<h4><i>"Spain"</i> from the CD <i><b>"Stranger Looking In"</b></i></h4><p>

<CENTER> <i>
"Landed in Spain just an hour ago <BR>
 Already I'm walking the streets <BR>
 I need a friend to heal my desperate soul <BR>
 Cold strangers are all that I meet..."
</i> </CENTER><p>

 	<b>Al Reingold</b> began to formally play piano at age 3.  
After a decade of recitals, competitions, and practice in both 
Suzuki and traditional methods, his interests led him to add 
contemporary rock-and-roll to his strict classical 
background.  Since moving to Atlanta in 1989, <b> Al Reingold</b> 
has been has been playing music professionally, from 
accompanying well-known local artists on stage to scoring an 
all-original soundtrack for a local production of <i>"Driving Miss 
Daisy."</i>  From this seamless blend of the traditional and 
digital worlds, <b>Reingold</b> creates a hauntingly familiar 
sound, that gently stretches the boundaries from the classical 
realm to the New Age.<p>

  	<b>Al Reingold</b> uses these unique melodic lines to frame 
his debut, <i><b>"Stranger Looking In"</i></b>, which 
<b>Reingold</b> released on his own label, <b>SLI Records, 
Ltd</b>.  This vast undertaking was completely arranged and 
produced by the artist himself, and ranges from rock-n-roll, to 
jazz, to blues, to classical and to the New Age.  He recorded 
each piece with different guest musicians, including some of 
Atlanta's finest players.  In addition to crafting the music 
and lyrics, <b>Al Reingold</b> plays piano, synthesizers, 
acoustic guitar, mandolin and percussion.<p>

Here's a listing of the players on the featured song, 
<b><i>"SPAIN"</i></b>:<br>

<dd><b>Al Reingold</b>, piano, rainstick
<dd><b>David Patterson</b>, classical guitar
<dd><b>Chris McMahon</b>, acoustic bass
<dd><b>Matthew Kahler</b>, congas</dl><p>

  	 Since releasing <i><b>"Stranger Looking In,"</i> 
Reingold</b> has returned to the stage in Chicago and Atlanta, 
now performing his own compositions as a solo artist.  
Furthermore, <b>Reingold</b> continually records his own new 
material and has two distinct albums in  the pre-production 
stages.<p>
