	Heralded by such sources as the City Revolt Publication 
and KSCU radio as one of the most original new acts to come out 
in years,  God Dog is an Industrial  blend of  hard-edged 
metal, synths, sampling and electronic effects.  Originating  
from the Bay Area, which has provided a breeding ground for 
several top-notch Industrial groups that have become major 
forces in the international world of  music, God Dog is one of 
the newer "Tech Metal" groups to burst upon the scene.<p> 

God Dog consists of  the electronic and vocal talents of  Steve 
Severino and guitarist/programmer, Mike Vaughn. The two have 
been working extensively since the fall of 1993 and have 
released a full-length independent CD, "Of Love, Death and 
Blood", as well as performing several live shows.  The self 
professed goal of God Dog is to take the combination of metal 
and electronic technology to areas yet to be explored. Their 
sound takes this union and manipulates it in a way that is 
innovative and exciting yet not experimental in terms of song 
structure and melody.  God Dog will appeal to people who like 
to hear Industrial music through a straight line rather than a 
jagged tunnel.<p>
   With the addition of drummer, programmer and 
synth master, Ben Padilla, God Dog are expanding their live 
shows and adding a plethora of new sounds and styles to new 
material while maintaining their Industrial edge.  Emphasis on 
diversity and quality, a commitment to integrity, a 
concentrated effort toward constant productivity and a growing 
loyal fan base mean God Dog will be around for years to come.<p>

"Of Love, Death, and Blood" is available by writing:<p>  </CENTER>

<CENTER><h2>EMISSION:</h2></CENTER>

	Emission, showcasing the talents of God Dog, is a 
combination of heavy guitar and driving beats interspersed with 
quieter moments of synth and programming orchestration.  The  
track is further enhanced by  layers of  electronic mayhem.  
The songs lyrics, delivered in a heavily distorted yet unique 
Industrial vocal style are about individuality and personal 
expression while not getting weighed down by the opinions and 
expectations of others. <p>
	An over all intense and 
aggressive song, God Dog feel it is one of the stronger tracks 
off their new full-length independent CD release "Of Love, 
Death, and Blood".<p>
