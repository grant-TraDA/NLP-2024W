<B>WRITING TEAM CREATES BOFFO CD AFTER RELEASE FROM 
HOSPITAL FOR CRIMINALLY UNEMPLOYABLE</B></CENTER>

<P>
The  comedy  writing  team  of  <B>Carol  Lee</B>  and  <B>Steve  Sea</B>  
were released  from  the  Washington  State  Hospital  for  the   Criminally
Unemployable today  to  promote  their  new  CD,  <I>Mouthbreather:  Humor
for  the  Totally  Incorrect,  Performed  by  the  Puget  Sound  Bytes</I>.
The pair, who met when the  poles  of  their  portable  IV's  of  
Maintainizine  collided  on  their  way   to   shock   treatment   therapy,
apparently  were  left  to  their  own  comedic  devices  when  the  TV
broke in the day room last week.
<P>
"I've listened to  the  CD  and  have  concluded  that  Frau  Lee
and  Herr  Sea  are  too  sick  for  this  facility,"  said  Chief   of
Psychiatry, Dr.  Sy Cotic.      "I'd   mistakenly  thought  there   was
hope for full recovery when they no longer insisted upon coming
to meals with their gowns open in  the  front,  but  when  they  didn't
respond to occupational therapy  and  got  on  this  joke  jag,  I  had
to let them go.       We  simply  cannot  tolerate   patients   wasting
valuable materials to make hand  buzzers  and  fake  barf,"  Dr.  Cotic
continued.
<P>
Although  unavailable  for  comment,  "Lee  and  Sea   vehemently
deny  having  made  the  CD  while  on  the  inside,"  an  unidentified
spokesman said.     "Actually,  one  day  they  were  so  bored,   they
escaped,  unnoticed,  and  ended-up  at  a  nearby   grange   hall   in
Chimacum,  Washington  where  they  happened  upon  a  bunch  of  other
former patients who  were  attempting  to  improvise  eco-based  comedy
bits for Seattle area  radio  station,  KSER.  Trying  to  turn  topics
as grim as acid rain dripping through  holes  in  the  ozone  into
knee slapping comedy, appealed to the two depressives right  away.
When Sea's old Radio Shack dictation  machine  caught  fire,"  the
spokesman continued, "the other inmates fled.    But Lee  and  Sea
stuck it out and deeply inhaled the toxic fumes which  became  the
streams of acerbic exhalations that ultimately led  to  the  creation 
of Mouthbreather.    With  no  hope  of  obtaining  corporate
financing, the desperate pair pooled their disability  checks  and
held hostage an innocent sound engineer who did an  award  winning
job of mixing an entire album with the jagged edge of a broken  IV
bottle at his throat.   The result  is  seventy-two  minutes  of
incisive, synapse blistering humor. <I>Mouthbreather: Humor  for  the
Totally Incorrect, Performed by the Puget Sound Bytes</I>. On  CD  and
Cassette.
