Only rarely does one come upon a distant relative that at once becomes
a familiar friend, possessing shared secrets that never cease to beguile.
Such is the case of <EM>Twice Removed</EM>, the astonishingly mature
debut from New York's <STRONG>distant cousins</STRONG>.  Like their
moniker, distant cousins are lower case in an upper-case world, a unique
school of fish ready to burst out of a big pond with the eclectic bag
of tricks they display on <EM>Twice Removed</EM>. <P>

First of all, these cousins are slyly deceptive.  While the playful
cover art and buoyant, rambling rhythms first suggest a party band, on
closer inspection <EM>Twice Removed</EM>'s songs have dark roots that
add depth to their danceability.  The album's opener, the raucous
<STRONG>"Elvis Did Karate"</STRONG> is a camp classic, but
singer/songwriter/guitarist <STRONG>Catherine Dail</STRONG>'s husky
wail imparts a simmering sensuality that's more Chrissie Hynde than
downtown dilettante.  And <STRONG>"Gotta Fly,"</STRONG> opening with
awkward, tentative bass notes reminiscent of Talking Head's "Psycho
Killer," turns into a Beatlesque rocker that details the ups and downs
of an obsessive relationship that refuses to end.  Even <STRONG>"Tambourine
Girl"</STRONG> a seemingly innocuous song propelled by bright vocals and
upbeat island <EM>riddims</EM>, describes a lovable misfit unable to fit
in, who "does not play the tuba, no no, because it weighs too much/And when
it comes to guitar playin' that girl ain't got the touch." <P>

Where distant cousins truly impress is their effortless 
ability to shift between many musical styles, often within the same song.
<EM>Twice Removed</EM> ranges from the chicken-scratch guitar and 
blue-eyed soul of <STRONG>"Pony"</STRONG> (where Dail strongly tells her
lover "don't ride me baby, I'm not your pony") to sophisticated, jazzy
pop like the smoky <STRONG>"Three Things"</STRONG> and quietly longing
<STRONG>"Love's Here Now"</STRONG>.  distant cousins even manage to
make having the <STRONG>"Minnesota Blues"</STRONG> sound like fun; combining
a humorous confessional with bar-band boogie, "Minnesota Blues" suggests an
unholy alliance between Laurie Anderson and the Spin Doctors. <P>

Underscoring the masterful songwriting is distant cousins' familial
musical virtuosity.  On "Elvis Did Karate" lead guitarist <STRONG>Jon
Diamond</STRONG> brings a hard, bluesy swagger to his soloing, then switches
to a mariachi stroll on <STRONG>"Burning Words."</STRONG> As well,
<STRONG>Joe "Mama" Holland</STRONG>'s harmonica provides a questioning 
counterpoint to the lyrics on <STRONG>"No Exception"</STRONG> and
<STRONG>Fred Gildes'</STRONG> subtle trombone shadings on "Pony" suggest
an indecision hiding behind Dail's outwardly tough stance.  When
necessary, distant cousins aren't afraid to bring in bongos, timbales,
organ or piano to flesh out an already well-fed groove.  And they're no
strangers to technology, either - check out the off-kilter samples that
ornament the otherworldly jam session <STRONG>"Lucky Magnet."</STRONG> <P>

Recalling both the past and the future, distant cousins appear
comfortable in their uncategorizable but homey place in-between the
in-betweens.  And from the sound of <EM>Twice Removed</EM>, these
cousins won't be distant for long.  Be sure to bring the family. <P>

<EM>
distant cousins' "Twice Removed" has really hit the college
radio waves with great success across the country.  The band has been on
the road early in '94 from ski and college gigs in Vermont and New
Hampshire to rockin' club dates in Boston, Philly, D.C. and elsewhere.
On their home turf of New York City, the cousins have played to raving
crowds at China Club, CBGCs, Wetlands, Village Gate, Lone Star, Bitter
End, etc!  Enjoy! <P>
