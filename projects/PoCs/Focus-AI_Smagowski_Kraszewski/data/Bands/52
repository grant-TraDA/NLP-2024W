thought-provoking.  She writes in a variety of styles, most recently 
concentrating on guitar-based pop-folk and children's music.  Her first

You let me down so gently<BR>
So carefully, so slow<BR>
I almost didn't get it<BR>
I almost didn't know<BR>
And when I finally understood<BR>
I almost didn't cry<BR>
It almost hurt me<BR>
When you said good-bye<BR>
'Cause you let me down so gently<BR>
"Cause you let me down so gently<BR>

You didn't need to worry<BR>
I'd do anything for you<BR>
I would have suffered long and hard<BR>
If you asked me to<BR>
But you let me down so gently<BR>

It's not your fault<BR>
You never meant me harm<BR>
You didn't know that I would find such rapture in your arms<BR>
It's not my fault<BR>
To fall in love with someone<BR>
Who would be so kind to me<BR>
And let me down so gently<BR>
You let me down so gently<BR>
