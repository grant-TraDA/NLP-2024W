<b><h2>Looking Glass</h2></b>
<i><b>-The band/The music</b></i><p> 
An avant-garde blending of spoken word lyrics with visually 
evocative, hypnotic music, <b>Looking Glass</b> invites you to share 
emotions that run from jagged to ethereal, futuristic to 
archetypal, slithering to sensual. The spoken word lyrics are 
somewhere between poetry and song lyrics: there are repeated 
elements as there would be in lyrics, but not bound by the 
verse/chorus format. As the material is not read as a poem 
would be, but spoken, the intent is for the listener to be able 
to take away something of what was heard, much as being able to 
remember a song's melody. In a creative blitz, 15 songs have 
been written and recorded from September of 1993 to today. 
KFJC, the radio station at 89.7 FM, is playing material from 
the demo tapes. Other radio stations are in the works.<p>

<b><h2><i>Out Of The Lair</i></h2></b>
<i>The song</i><p>
It's the 1890's. You're in an opium den in England. It's dark, 
smoky and red hued: Blood red walls, dark red tapestries on the 
floor, red velvet sofas along the walls. Whether it's the smoke 
or the effect of the smoke on your mind, it's hard to tell real 
from illusion, pysical from imagined. Lewis Carroll wrote about 
what this feels like in <i>Through The Looking Glass</i>. Enough 
hints? <b>Listen to the song...</b><p>
