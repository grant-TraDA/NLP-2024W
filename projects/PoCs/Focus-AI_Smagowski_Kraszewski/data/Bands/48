<b>What the Cat Dragged In</b> is an <b>unsigned</b> and flat broke band
of Yale graduate students.  Originally formed in late 1992, the band has played 
numerous clubs in the New Haven area as well as the annual Summertime
Street Festival. The band's instrumentation includes (but is not limited
to) guitar, keyboards, bass and drums.<p>

On Nov. 5, 1994, the band released its first full-length CD,
<b>Scratch Tracks</b>.  This entirely independent release was 
co-produced with Jim Chapdelaine (Mr. Right).  The CD contains
12 tracks for a total running time of 54:02 and includes an 8 panel
full-color insert with lyrics, pictures, and graphics.  
<b>Big Love</b> is the first track off the CD to receive air time.<p>

All of us take turns at lead vocal which adds alot of variety to our
music.  Additionally, we each come to the band from different musical 
backgrounds, so our music moves through the entire spectrum of genres.
The above song was chosen for distribution through IUMA because we feel it
represents an intriguing combination of our musical interests.<p>

while posing as a mild-mannered professor at Vassar. 
He plays a
Hamer Special (made back in the days when Hamer was still a designer in the
company) and thinks Richard Thompson is the greatest guitar player 
alive (but still listens to just about everything else.) <P>  
<DT><img alt="o" src="/IUMA/lib/whiteball.gif"><b>Marco Mazzi</b>: Drums
<DD>Marco still lives in New London, CT, his hometown for life, and makes
the hour long drive for practices, shows, and classes. An RPI grad, he's
studying electrical engineering. Marco plays Slingerland drums, is a big
time Marillion fan, and knows a few guys named Vinny. <P>  
<DT><img alt="o" src="/IUMA/lib/greenball.gif"><b>John McEachen</b>: Bass,
Harmonica, Guitar

major. A Notre Dame alum, he can consistently be found in front of the
TV on Saturday afternoons. 
John plays a 6-string Alembic Elan. A former member of the
defunct bluegrass combo <i>Whistler's Brother</i>, he has some pretty 
hefty country/folk persuasions.<P>
