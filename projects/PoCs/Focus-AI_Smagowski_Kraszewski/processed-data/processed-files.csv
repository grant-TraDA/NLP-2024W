<h2>Anybody Can</h2>

Blessed with the twin gifts of a beautiful voice and a soaring sense of
melody, Susan Kessey composes simple powerful songs From self reflection
to innocent lullabies. There is an unusual quality of faith and openness
that is somehow solid, like that of a believing child -- in all that 
Susan Kessey performs.It shows in her voice, a slim, silky sound that 
sweetly leads the instruments on her songs, whether one guitar or a whole 
acoustic band.It appears in her melodies, which are simple but strong, 
and often unforgettable after only one hearing.And it comes in her 
lyrics, most of which are encouragements to confidence and belief.Kessey 
has already established a following in schools and among family groups 
with her deeply positive music, and is increasingly sought for concert 
appearances as her reputation spreads. <b>Anybody Can</b>, the title tune of 
her fourteen-song album, shows Susan Kessey at her best.Download it on a 
grey or difficult day, and feel the room begin to change.<p>

Only rarely does one come upon a distant relative that at once becomes
a familiar friend, possessing shared secrets that never cease to beguile.
Such is the case of <EM>Twice Removed</EM>, the astonishingly mature
debut from New York's <STRONG>distant cousins</STRONG>.  Like their
moniker, distant cousins are lower case in an upper-case world, a unique
school of fish ready to burst out of a big pond with the eclectic bag
of tricks they display on <EM>Twice Removed</EM>. <P>

First of all, these cousins are slyly deceptive.  While the playful
cover art and buoyant, rambling rhythms first suggest a party band, on
closer inspection <EM>Twice Removed</EM>'s songs have dark roots that
add depth to their danceability.  The album's opener, the raucous
<STRONG>""Elvis Did Karate""</STRONG> is a camp classic, but
singer/songwriter/guitarist <STRONG>Catherine Dail</STRONG>'s husky
wail imparts a simmering sensuality that's more Chrissie Hynde than
downtown dilettante.  And <STRONG>""Gotta Fly,""</STRONG> opening with
awkward, tentative bass notes reminiscent of Talking Head's ""Psycho
Killer,"" turns into a Beatlesque rocker that details the ups and downs
of an obsessive relationship that refuses to end.  Even <STRONG>""Tambourine
Girl""</STRONG> a seemingly innocuous song propelled by bright vocals and
upbeat island <EM>riddims</EM>, describes a lovable misfit unable to fit
in, who ""does not play the tuba, no no, because it weighs too much/And when
it comes to guitar playin' that girl ain't got the touch."" <P>

Where distant cousins truly impress is their effortless 
ability to shift between many musical styles, often within the same song.
<EM>Twice Removed</EM> ranges from the chicken-scratch guitar and 
blue-eyed soul of <STRONG>""Pony""</STRONG> (where Dail strongly tells her
lover ""don't ride me baby, I'm not your pony"") to sophisticated, jazzy
pop like the smoky <STRONG>""Three Things""</STRONG> and quietly longing
<STRONG>""Love's Here Now""</STRONG>.  distant cousins even manage to
make having the <STRONG>""Minnesota Blues""</STRONG> sound like fun; combining
a humorous confessional with bar-band boogie, ""Minnesota Blues"" suggests an
unholy alliance between Laurie Anderson and the Spin Doctors. <P>

Underscoring the masterful songwriting is distant cousins' familial
musical virtuosity.  On ""Elvis Did Karate"" lead guitarist <STRONG>Jon
Diamond</STRONG> brings a hard, bluesy swagger to his soloing, then switches
to a mariachi stroll on <STRONG>""Burning Words.""</STRONG> As well,
<STRONG>Joe ""Mama"" Holland</STRONG>'s harmonica provides a questioning 
counterpoint to the lyrics on <STRONG>""No Exception""</STRONG> and
<STRONG>Fred Gildes'</STRONG> subtle trombone shadings on ""Pony"" suggest
an indecision hiding behind Dail's outwardly tough stance.  When
necessary, distant cousins aren't afraid to bring in bongos, timbales,
organ or piano to flesh out an already well-fed groove.  And they're no
strangers to technology, either - check out the off-kilter samples that
ornament the otherworldly jam session <STRONG>""Lucky Magnet.""</STRONG> <P>

Recalling both the past and the future, distant cousins appear
comfortable in their uncategorizable but homey place in-between the
in-betweens.  And from the sound of <EM>Twice Removed</EM>, these
cousins won't be distant for long.  Be sure to bring the family. <P>

<HR>

<EM>
distant cousins' ""Twice Removed"" has really hit the college
radio waves with great success across the country.  The band has been on
the road early in '94 from ski and college gigs in Vermont and New
Hampshire to rockin' club dates in Boston, Philly, D.C. and elsewhere.
On their home turf of New York City, the cousins have played to raving
crowds at China Club, CBGCs, Wetlands, Village Gate, Lone Star, Bitter
End, etc!  Enjoy! <P>

in, who ""does not play the tuba, no no, because it weighs too much/And when
it comes to guitar playin' that girl ain't got the touch."" <p>

Where distant cousins truly impress is their effortless 
ability to shift between many musical styles, often within the same song.
<em>Twice Removed</em> ranges from the chicken-scratch guitar and 
blue-eyed soul of <strong>""Pony""</strong> (where Dail strongly tells her
lover ""don't ride me baby, I'm not your pony"") to sophisticated, jazzy
pop like the smoky <strong>""Three Things""</strong> and quietly longing
<strong>""Love's Here Now""</strong>.  distant cousins even manage to
make having the <strong>""Minnesota Blues""</strong> sound like fun; combining
a humorous confessional with bar-band boogie, ""Minnesota Blues"" suggests an
unholy alliance between Laurie Anderson and the Spin Doctors. <p>

Underscoring the masterful songwriting is distant cousins' familial
musical virtuosity.  On ""Elvis Did Karate"" lead guitarist <strong>Jon
Diamond</strong> brings a hard, bluesy swagger to his soloing, then switches
to a mariachi stroll on <strong>""Burning Words.""</strong> As well,
<strong>Joe ""Mama"" Holland</strong>'s harmonica provides a questioning 
counterpoint to the lyrics on <strong>""No Exception""</strong> and
<strong>Fred Gildes'</strong> subtle trombone shadings on ""Pony"" suggest
an indecision hiding behind Dail's outwardly tough stance.  When
necessary, distant cousins aren't afraid to bring in bongos, timbales,
organ or piano to flesh out an already well-fed groove.  And they're no
strangers to technology, either - check out the off-kilter samples that
ornament the otherworldly jam session <strong>""Lucky Magnet.""</strong> <p>

Recalling both the past and the future, distant cousins appear
comfortable in their uncategorizable but homey place in-between the
in-betweens.  And from the sound of <em>Twice Removed</em>, these
cousins won't be distant for long.  Be sure to bring the family. <p>
<hr/>
<em>
distant cousins' ""Twice Removed"" has really hit the college
radio waves with great success across the country.  The band has been on
the road early in '94 from ski and college gigs in Vermont and New
Hampshire to rockin' club dates in Boston, Philly, D.C. and elsewhere.
On their home turf of New York City, the cousins have played to raving
crowds at China Club, CBGCs, Wetlands, Village Gate, Lone Star, Bitter
End, etc!  Enjoy! <p>

<H2> ""Tom Waits meets Tracey Ullman.""</H2><P>

""This crazy chick should turn VH-1 on its ear."" --<I> The Music Paper
</I></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Mary Ellen Bernard</B> just doesn't know how to fit in. Her debut 
recording <I><B>Point of Departure</B></I> was described by a New York radio 
personality as
""Tom Waits meets Tracey Ullman."" (Huh?) See, it's not quite pop, not
quite jazz, not quite blues, not quite folk -- and yet, a little of
each. And some of it's kind of, well ... funny. What's a radio
programmer to do? Well ... play it! And they have ... at WXPN in
Philadelphia ... WGBH in Boston ... the ""Z-100 Morning Zoo"" in New York
city ... KSER in Seattle... even Radio Riga in Latvia! (Yes, Latvia.)
And listeners love it.<P>

On Point of Departure Mary Ellen and producer Paul Guzzone are more
musically extravagant than is currently feasible in her live shows.
Here, the Patty Larkin song ""Caffeine"" is a full-fledged big-band
number. Other tracks feature (live, not sampled) Brazilian percussion,
horn sections, even bird calls. (Okay, the bird calls are sampled --
with permission, of course.) ""We tried desperately to use every
musician in New York,"" Mary Ellen says of the undertaking. ""We didn't,
but you still get your money's worth.""<P>

Mary Ellen has been playing live at such Northeast clubs as The Iron
Horse Music Hall in Northampton, MA; The Godfrey Daniels in Bethlehem,
PA; The Bitter End in New York city, The Towne Crier in Pawling, NY and
other folk clubs, coffee houses, jazz & blues rooms, theaters and
festivals. She's opened shows for Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, John
Sebastian and Saffire: Uppity Blues Women.<P>

Backed by keyboards and bass/acoustic guitar (and sometimes violin),
her concerts center mostly on rootsy blues and jazz, bittersweet
ballads and her signature ""wacky production numbers."" ""Caffeine"" has
become one of these and so has the John Prine/Fred Koller collaboration
""Let's Talk Dirty in Hawaiian."" Recently some original tunes have
entered this category as well. ""My mission is to disprove the theory
that no one ever laughs in a folk club,"" she states. ""I'll be working
on jazz clubs next.""<P>

<B>Order NOW!</B><BR>

CD and cassette. Also available is the incredibly cool Mary Ellen
Bernard T-Shirt!<P>

<P>
After years of experience and dedication this swirling musical mass
known as <B>Crosswind</B> now surges to gale force. Fed by an encouraging
musical climate and drawing from potent wells of knowledge and
ability, Crosswind has developed into a serious storm of sound and
fury, ready to establish sovereignty. Quickly take this opportunity to
examine the conditions and prevailing atmospheric circumstances that
have merged and intersected to proudly produce Crosswind.
<P>
First there were simple honest goals which were almost always the
truest direction to take. Often it takes a band or any collection of
musicians a long time to arrive at that realization. Some never reach
such a lofty level of understanding, but wallow hopelessly lost in
bandwagon jumping, trend-observing confusion. Crosswind, however, is an
example of a band whose members have come nearly full circle in
development and found themselves staring squarely at the musical bottom
line-- go with what you know!!
<P>
Diligently working thir way through ideas,expectations, views and
objectives, often by way of countless ""hell gigs"" - the members of
this bluesy guitar-driven rock ensemble: vocalist <B>Dana Hall</B>, guitarist
<B>Scottie Jordan</B>, bass player <B>Rich Barefoot</B> and drummer <B>Dan Ross</B>; have
been savvy enough to grasp the concept that experience, a good work
ethic and a straightforward stand is often the only way to rock and
roll heaven. Sadly, today, the industry weather report frequently
features bands that are here today, gone later today Not Crosswind!
<P>
The band has gathered strength around a brooding, talented and
misleading calm eye - lead vocalist Dana Hall. She is the focal center
of the Crosswind storm. She and her compatriots know that while
success would be wonderful, being good, really good, offers the
greater reward. Thus, the die was cast, their lot thrown together.
<P>
Crosswind was originally born out of the demise of several other
Charlotte, N.C.-area bands. ""We were scared,"" Dana admits, ""we had to
start over from scratch. Now, we've done a lot of road work, that has
helped me to understand the idea of entertainment. Now it feels so
good to be up there singing for other people, not for me -- but for
everybody out there!""
<P>
With well over 300 gigs under their belt, Crosswind has established a
solid live show and appeared alongside major regional and national
acts (yes, some of these bands are still around!) such as: .38
Special, Mothers Finest, Kansas, Nightranger, The Outlaws,
Steppenwolf, Copperhead, Molly Hatchet, Three Dog Night, The Georgia
Satellites and Cry of Love.
<P>
Calling Crosswind a ""Southern-fried version of The Who"" Jordan
believes that the availability of the bands music is a big part of the
success equation. To fulfill that requirement, Crosswind recorded nine
original songs on a cassette album entitled ""Can You Feel It?"" that
they plan to distribute ""everywhere possible"".  Recorded at White Room
Studios in Charlotte, the new music on ""Can You Feel It?"" is a real
representation of the soul of Crosswind.""Our sound is simple"", says
Hall. ""We write what we feel, not what we think we're expected to
write."" Calling the band's sound a mixture of Southern rock, anthem
rock, the blues and hard rock, she adds ""This band has lots of energy.
We pour it out onto the audiences in much the same fashion as a lot of
70's bands. We feed off the crowd and in return the crowd feeds off
us.""

<I>Their better original stuff leans toward moody Led Zeppelin and raucous

singer/songwriter. I don't like to define my style because I have
always felt that was someone else's job. I like to write about things I
feel passionate about and communicate my feelings through songwriting.
I think my music is unique because although I'd like a career in music,
that is not my motivation. Making music is very spiritual and songs are
like prayers for me. My songs are always analytical, sometimes topical
and occasionally political because I want the listeners to get
emotional about, think about or get angry about a subject they were
previously unfamiliar with. I think a good song can get under your skin
and bring up emotions you never knew were there.<P>

<B>Brief description of song:</B><P>

<I>Automo Joe:</I><P>

A tribute to Jimi Hendrix. The idea was to make my voice not only sing
the lyrics but also sound like a guitar. Then for the guitar to tell
the rest of the story when I stopped singing the lyrics. I'm very proud
of this production because it's the first record I produced that sounds
exactly the way I wanted it to sound. I also incorporated elements of
""Hey Joe"" and other Hendrix riffs into this song.<P>

<I>America:</I><P>

I wanted this to sound like it's coming from the point of view of a
Native American which is why I used tribal drum sounds. This is
combined with military marching band sounds because the song is about
how greed, power and the desire for world domination can destroy a
beautiful country. The intro and outro are excerpts of Gospel singer
Marion Williams' ""They Lead my Lord Away"".<P>

<CENTER> <h2>Lyrics</h2> </CENTER>

<B>AUTOMO JOE</B><P>

In an age when popular musicians rely highly on sex, gimmickry and
shameless hype to influence audiences and boost record sales, <B>Barbara
Markay</B> is a standout talent with extraordinary musical abilities.
<P>
With roots grounded in a solid classical music background, Ms. Markay
has worked with some of the top names in the industry, ranging trom
Quincy Jones and Eric Clapton, to Carly Simon and George Duke. Her
credits have also been splashed across Michael Jackson's ""BAD"" video,
directed by Martin Scorsese, and on the Saturday Night Live band through
Leon Pendarvis - the band's keyboard player with whom she worked.
<P>
Ms. Markay started out by winning a scholarship to New York's
prestigious
Juilliard School of Music where she studied composition with Roger
Sessions and developed into an outstanding classical pianist. But despite
her exceptional ability as a classical musician, she could not be confined
to that genre. While still wearing pigtails and braces on her teeth, Ms.
Markay was called on to showcase her prodigious talents to the European
community as part of a popular college rock and roll tour sponsored by a
couple of Britain's better known producers. She met the challenge    by
performing to standing ovations on many European campuses.  Upon
arrival back to the United States, she was invited to perform in her own
Miami Beach rock and roll review. She quickly followed that success with
a dance music hit, ""It's Allrite,"" (released on WEA International in Holland).
The tune wowed audiences in clubs all across the United States, and
romped up the international music charts reaching an enviable No. 19 in
Holland. That achievement was soon overshadowed by ""I Don't Wanna Be
A Zombie,"" which zoomed to No. 2 on the French music charts, and
demonstrated beyond a doubt that ""It's Allrite"" was no musical fluke.
<P>
In between these many successes Ms. Markay further demonstrated her
multi-faceted musical talents with solid credits in live performances,
record dates, voice-overs, background vocals, and jingles for which she
was in great demand in New York City where she lived and worked until
moving to the West Coast two years ago. Ms. Markay recently completed
her latest album, ""Change To Come"" which she composed, arranged and
produced, and on which she is also the lead vocalist and plays a number
of musical instruments. The album features a dazzling array of
background musicians, and has been getting rave reviews trom a number
of well-respected music critics.

<B>DESCRIPTION OF MUSIC</B>:
<P>
""Change To Come"" is an exciting, eclectic combination
 of songs which
underscores the artist's spiritual and professional growth. 
The 11 tunes featured on this
album shows a sensitivity for and understanding of the 
troubling  issues  which  threaten  to
ravage our world--women's rights, the environment, 
the human condition, intolerance,
and the overriding need for universal love. 
Markay has pulled  this  universality  of  themes
together with an ingenious and exuberant intermingling 
of musical  styles.  The  album  is  a
triumph. Markay's fine-tuned musical acumen create 
an album that is professionally
well-crafted, stylish and musically superior. 
The result is a commercially viable yet
creatively exceptional gem that is destined 
for success!

In an age when popular musicians rely highly on sex, gimmickry and
shameless hype to influence audiences and boost record sales, __BarbaraMarkay__ is a standout talent with extraordinary musical abilities.

With roots grounded in a solid classical music background, Ms. Markayhas worked with some of the top names in the industry, ranging tromQuincy Jones and Eric Clapton, to Carly Simon and George Duke. Hercredits have also been splashed across Michael Jackson's ""BAD"" video,directed by Martin Scorsese, and on the Saturday Night Live band throughLeon Pendarvis - the band's keyboard player with whom she worked.

Ms. Markay started out by winning a scholarship to New York'sprestigiousJuilliard School of Music where she studied composition with RogerSessions and developed into an outstanding classical pianist. But despiteher exceptional ability as a classical musician, she could not be confinedto that genre. While still wearing pigtails and braces on her teeth, Ms.Markay was called on to showcase her prodigious talents to the Europeancommunity as part of a popular college rock and roll tour sponsored by acouple of Britain's better known producers. She met the challenge byperforming to standing ovations on many European campuses. Uponarrival back to the United States, she was invited to perform in her ownMiami Beach rock and roll review. She quickly followed that success witha dance music hit, ""It's Allrite,"" (released on WEA International in Holland).The tune wowed audiences in clubs all across the United States, andromped up the international music charts reaching an enviable No. 19 inHolland. That achievement was soon overshadowed by ""I Don't Wanna BeA Zombie,"" which zoomed to No. 2 on the French music charts, anddemonstrated beyond a doubt that ""It's Allrite"" was no musical fluke.

In between these many successes Ms. Markay further demonstrated hermulti-faceted musical talents with solid credits in live performances,record dates, voice-overs, background vocals, and jingles for which shewas in great demand in New York City where she lived and worked untilmoving to the West Coast two years ago. Ms. Markay recently completedher latest album, ""Change To Come"" which she composed, arranged andproduced, and on which she is also the lead vocalist and plays a numberof musical instruments. The album features a dazzling array ofbackground musicians, and has been getting rave reviews trom a numberof well-respected music critics.

	Heralded by such sources as the City Revolt Publication 
and KSCU radio as one of the most original new acts to come out 
in years,  God Dog is an Industrial  blend of  hard-edged 
metal, synths, sampling and electronic effects.  Originating  
from the Bay Area, which has provided a breeding ground for 
several top-notch Industrial groups that have become major 
forces in the international world of  music, God Dog is one of 
the newer ""Tech Metal"" groups to burst upon the scene.<p> 

God Dog consists of  the electronic and vocal talents of  Steve 
Severino and guitarist/programmer, Mike Vaughn. The two have 
been working extensively since the fall of 1993 and have 
released a full-length independent CD, ""Of Love, Death and 
Blood"", as well as performing several live shows.  The self 
professed goal of God Dog is to take the combination of metal 
and electronic technology to areas yet to be explored. Their 
sound takes this union and manipulates it in a way that is 
innovative and exciting yet not experimental in terms of song 
structure and melody.  God Dog will appeal to people who like 
to hear Industrial music through a straight line rather than a 
jagged tunnel.<p>
   With the addition of drummer, programmer and 
synth master, Ben Padilla, God Dog are expanding their live 
shows and adding a plethora of new sounds and styles to new 
material while maintaining their Industrial edge.  Emphasis on 
diversity and quality, a commitment to integrity, a 
concentrated effort toward constant productivity and a growing 
loyal fan base mean God Dog will be around for years to come.<p>

	Emission, showcasing the talents of God Dog, is a 
combination of heavy guitar and driving beats interspersed with 
quieter moments of synth and programming orchestration.  The  
track is further enhanced by  layers of  electronic mayhem.  
The songs lyrics, delivered in a heavily distorted yet unique 
Industrial vocal style are about individuality and personal 
expression while not getting weighed down by the opinions and 
expectations of others. <p>
	An over all intense and 
aggressive song, God Dog feel it is one of the stronger tracks

<B>a brief history</B>:
<P>
started in 1994 as an acoustic guitar and percussion duo, elizabeth
gone spun itself into an alternative acoustic rock band by 1995. the
groups diversified sound has caused a growing interest among a wide
variety of tastes. elizabeth gone performs everywhere from small cafes
and college hangouts to large showcase venues like new yorks CBGBs and
Mercury Lounge.  singer/songwriter vincent james combines a haunting
musical element with poetic lyrics of dark human emotion and surrounds
his traumatic vocal with textural violin melodies, acoustic rhythmic
drive and psychedelic folk.

among the ever expanding and changing repertoire are many compositions
which have been cited to be the gems of the lot, one of which is far
from heaven. given the tragically beautiful lyrics and vocals the song
leaves one feeling the utter loss of spirit the songwriter felt. the
song was also chosen by filmmaker luis mullen as the musical backdrop
for one of his recent works.

<FONT SIZE=+4>T</FONT>he five members of Black Rain have been together 
since June, 1989.  As a collaborative group, they have written several 
hundred songs.  While Black Rain's current play list consists of forty of 
their strongest tunes, they are continually writing and performing new 
material.<p>

One of the band's most noted performances took place at the <B>California 
Mid-State Fair</B> in August, 1993, where they opened up for the <B>Damn 
Yankees</B>, featuring <B>Ted Nugent</B> and <B>Tommy Shaw</B>.  Other 
major California venues have included <B>Dream Street</B> in San Diego; 
<B>Marquee</B> in Westminster and the <B>SLO Brew Company</B> in San Luis 
Obispo.<P>

Black Rain's high energy live performances and area radio play have 
created an ever increasing consumer demand for their recorded music.  
Regional Wherehouse record stores continually sell through  inventories 
of the band's latest LP titled ""Black Rain"".  Black Rain's unique sound 
has been described as Rock with a Blues tinge.<P>

The band enjoys tremendous success in Central California and continues to 
win new fans of all ages.  When not on stage, Black Rain can be found in 
the studio recording their newest songs.<P>

he five members of Black Rain have been together 
since June, 1989.  As a collaborative group, they have written several 
hundred songs.  While Black Rain's current play list consists of forty of 
their strongest tunes, they are continually writing and performing new 
material.

One of the band's most noted performances took place at the __California Mid-State Fair__ in August, 1993, where they opened up for the __Damn Yankees__, featuring __Ted Nugent__ and __Tommy Shaw__. Other major California venues have included __Dream Street__ in San Diego; __Marquee__ in Westminster and the __SLO Brew Company__ in San Luis Obispo.

Black Rain's high energy live performances and area radio play have created an ever increasing consumer demand for their recorded music. Regional Wherehouse record stores continually sell through inventories of the band's latest LP titled ""Black Rain"". Black Rain's unique sound has been described as Rock with a Blues tinge.

The band enjoys tremendous success in Central California and continues to win new fans of all ages. When not on stage, Black Rain can be found in the studio recording their newest songs.

<I>Ordinary Man</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All I am, an ordinary man, and Ive got some very ordinary plans I like
to sit down, think, and figure out where my life is going and just what
its been about.  Time, time to look ahead Time, time to look behind
<P>
Planning for the future Ill evaluate my needs, do my best and try to
make each dream reality Not everything I do will all work out, like all
of us, I make mistakes, a less-than-perfect cut.  And it bleeds, I see
red blood run Scars go deep, and the pain lives on
<P>
There are those days when I want to...
<P>
Days turn into months turn into years, yesterdays as far away as
tomorrows getting near And here I am an ordinary man, someday Ill be
memories, someday Ill be dust.  Time, time to look ahead Time, time to
look behind
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<I>The Hammer Song</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Look at me. Its not true that no-one cares. Ill give you what kindness
I can afford, but theres something I want in return:  No more penance
for the power you were born with; a gift is not a crime. All you owe
the world is a healthy respect. Dont let it kill your light.
<P>
Dont be afraid of the sun inside you, unveil that secret heat Youre not
quite alone, and youre exactly as strong as you feel you need to be.
<P>
Dont whine at me about the weight of the world, it comes down
everywhere. As friends, we can only try to even out the load, and make
it a little less unfair. Pressures inside build a burning diamond, and
though were all a little flawed, still if you look hard enough youll
find that inner light where they got the idea for God.
<P>
Dont be afraid...

> There are those days when I want to...

> Days turn into months turn into years, yesterdays as far away astomorrows getting near And here I am an ordinary man, someday Ill bememories, someday Ill be dust. Time, time to look ahead Time, time tolook behind

_The Hammer Song_>  Look at me. Its not true that no-one cares. Ill give you what kindnessI can afford, but theres something I want in return: No more penancefor the power you were born with; a gift is not a crime. All you owethe world is a healthy respect. Dont let it kill your light.
> Dont be afraid of the sun inside you, unveil that secret heat Youre notquite alone, and youre exactly as strong as you feel you need to be.
> 
> Dont whine at me about the weight of the world, it comes downeverywhere. As friends, we can only try to even out the load, and makeit a little less unfair. Pressures inside build a burning diamond, andthough were all a little flawed, still if you look hard enough youllfind that inner light where they got the idea for God.

<H1>Jim Andrews</H1>
</CENTER>


Jim is a native of Charlotte, North Carolina, and moved to Nashville in 1982 to
attend Belmont College where he graduated with a Bachelors degree in Music
Business in 1985.  Having performed various types of Music, he then began to
record solo acoustic guitar pieces which were compiled for his first release
""Storytale"" in 1988.<P>



While searching for a new and unique medium, Jim began composing music for
Doppelgitarre (a type of German harp guitar) in 1989.  Having been introduced to
engineer/producer Howard Toole in 1989, the two decided to co-produce an album. 
""Music For Doppelgitarre"" was released in 1990.  Jim performed in various places
in Tennessee, then moved back to Charlotte in 1991.  Since that time, Jim has
been performing in various venues in the southeast, as well as composing
instrumental music for the forthcoming release ""Pure White Monday"" and
guitar/vocal music for his performances and future recordings.<P>



""Music for Doppelgitarre"" is a collection of ten solo doppelgitarre pieces.  The
music is very melodic in structure, and intended to convey a sense of serenity,
color, and warmth.  As stated in a review by Guitar Player magazine, ""perfect for
a morning cup of Java or an evening of quiet solitude.""  ""Pure White Monday"",
however,  is more diverse containing different musical styles including pieces
for guitar,  doppelgitarre, guitar synthesizer, and piano.  Jim's vocal music is
rather like ""introspective folk"", with lyrics to ""live by"" and both flowing and
aggressive guitar phrases.<P>



To order ""Music for Doppelgitarre"" send $14.00 for CD or $9.00 for cassette plus
$1.50 shipping to CIR,  P.O. Box 12505, Charlotte, NC 28220.  ""Pure White Monday""
is not yet released as Jim is looking for a record company with interest in
marketing it.  For bookings or industry information, call 704/344-1819 or e-mail
jandrews@cybernetics.net.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>""Momentum""  <I>from ""Music for Doppelgitarre""</I></FONT><P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
The mood for this piece is described by its title.  It contains intricate phrases
with harp string melodies mixed with quick guitar picking.  The melody, as
always, is evident as it strikes the contemplative side of the listener.
</BLOCKQUOTE>



<FONT SIZE=+2>""Serenity""  - <I>a live guitar/vocal recording</I></FONT><P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
The title is somewhat ironic, as this is one of the more aggressive pieces.  It
represents a good example of the diversity found in one of Jim's performances.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<FONT SIZE=+2>""Doppelwerk""  <I>from ""Pure White Monday""</I></FONT><P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
This piece contains contrasting phrases from the doppelgitarre and piano.  The
movement continues a steady pace throughout the song, and the song was titled
""Doppelwerk"" as it sounds like a more melodic, acoustic version of a well known
German techno band.

</H2>
<I>""EVERYTHING YOU WRITE SOUNDS TO ME LIKE DEATH""</I><P>
</CENTER>
<hr>
....is from his latest--and greatest--cassette relaese, <I>Scott 
Brookman: A National Treasure</I>, a stunning ten song set from Salem, 
Vigrinia's own pop meister of recorded sound.  Each song on the tape has 
a 100% guaranteed hummable melody.  The song you're about to hear is a 
thrilling indictment of today's rock (you know who you are): tuneless 
songs with no melody or harmony, I mean, I just don't get it.  And this 
little number rocks as well.  I only hope that you can dig it.  And 
please do.<P>

Media Coverage of Scott Brookman: <I>Details, Rolling Stone, San 
Francisco Examiner, The Arizona Republic, Mondo 2000, and Good Times, 
</I> all available in the ""Press Coverage of IUMA"" file.  Reviews of the 
previous cassette have appeared in <I>Improvijazzanation</I> and will 
perhaps appear in <I>Gajoob</I> and <I>Yellow Pills</I> this year.
<P>
To get your copy of the tape--and friends, why be satisfied with a measly 
one song downloading when you can groove for a full 46-minutes?!--click on the ""Ordering Info"" button above in the toolbar, or send 
five bucks, a mere pittance, in check form, made payable to:

<h1>""Organs Was Only the Beginning.....</h1><p>
<h2>NOW<br/>
YOU MUST HEAR THE EXCITING NEW SONG BY<br/>
SCOTT BROOKMAN<br/>
BEFORE YOU GO MAD!<p>
</p></h2>
<i>""EVERYTHING YOU WRITE SOUNDS TO ME LIKE DEATH""</i><p>
</p></p></center>

---

....is from his latest--and greatest--cassette relaese, _Scott Brookman: A National Treasure_, a stunning ten song set from Salem, 
Vigrinia's own pop meister of recorded sound.  Each song on the tape has 
a 100% guaranteed hummable melody.  The song you're about to hear is a 
thrilling indictment of today's rock (you know who you are): tuneless 
songs with no melody or harmony, I mean, I just don't get it.  And this 
little number rocks as well.  I only hope that you can dig it.  And 
please do.

Media Coverage of Scott Brookman: _Details, Rolling Stone, San Francisco Examiner, The Arizona Republic, Mondo 2000, and Good Times, _ all available in the ""Press Coverage of IUMA"" file. Reviews of the previous cassette have appeared in _Improvijazzanation_ and will perhaps appear in _Gajoob_ and _Yellow Pills_ this year.

To get your copy of the tape--and friends, why be satisfied with a measly one song downloading when you can groove for a full 46-minutes?!--click on the ""Ordering Info"" button above in the toolbar, or send five bucks, a mere pittance, in check form, made payable to:

<h1>The <I>RAPANESE</I> method</h1>
First the lyrics (each of twelve lessons) are repeated slowly 
without music in both Spanish and English, just like 
conventional language tapes.  Then the lyrics are repeated with 
AWESOME music.  We repeat the Spanish and English words and 
phrases up to 4 times for the longer phrases.  <B>YOU DO NOT 
GET BORED</B> because your mind fixates on the music and you 
pick up the Spanish the way you pick up words to your favorite 
song.  <B>YOUR MIND BECOMES BILINGUAL.</B><P>

<h2>The Result</h2>

You may be in a Spanish Restaurant and hear ""Disculpame.""  Right 
away you think ""Excuse Me.""  It becomes automatic.  You 
actually think in English but speak in Spanish (in the 
beginning.)<P>

<h2>History of <I>RAPANESE</I></h2>

Rapanese was created by a Canadian, ex-disc jockey, school 
teacher, Mike D'Amours.  He started using Rapanese in his 
classroom of 25 students in 1989.  Since then, the Kelowna 
Secondary School, B.C. Canada, has had to hire a second 
language instructor to cope with the 5 fold increase in 
demand in only 2 years.<p>

<I>Available in French, Spanish, and Japanese</I><BR>
<I>Look for our continuing series</I><P>

<h1>The <i>RAPANESE</i> method</h1>
First the lyrics (each of twelve lessons) are repeated slowly 
without music in both Spanish and English, just like 
conventional language tapes.  Then the lyrics are repeated with 
AWESOME music.  We repeat the Spanish and English words and 
phrases up to 4 times for the longer phrases.  <b>YOU DO NOT 
GET BORED</b> because your mind fixates on the music and you 
pick up the Spanish the way you pick up words to your favorite 
song.  <b>YOUR MIND BECOMES BILINGUAL.</b><p>
<h2>The Result</h2>

You may be in a Spanish Restaurant and hear ""Disculpame.""  Right 
away you think ""Excuse Me.""  It becomes automatic.  You 
actually think in English but speak in Spanish (in the 
beginning.)<p>
<h2>History of <i>RAPANESE</i></h2>

Rapanese was created by a Canadian, ex-disc jockey, school 
teacher, Mike D'Amours.  He started using Rapanese in his 
classroom of 25 students in 1989.  Since then, the Kelowna 
Secondary School, B.C. Canada, has had to hire a second 
language instructor to cope with the 5 fold increase in 
demand in only 2 years.<p>

ISIKOJAM, whose musicians come from Nigeria, Cameroon, Boston, and San
Francisco, is a fusion of musical ideas from these parts of the
world.<P>

ISIKOJAM was formed while Kirk Casey, Soul Maah, and Maanas Itene were
backing various South African and reggae artists in the San Francisco
Bay Area. Kirk brought keyboardist Jonathan Ridpath to the group, and
after one night of playing that was it! ""It felt as though we had been
playing together for years.""<P>

ISIKOJAM combines many styles of music and fuses them together to
produce music that is very groove oriented with distinct melodies.<P>
<DL> <DT>BASS: <DD> Simon (Soul) Maah from Cameroon played with EKAMBI
Brilliant and Manu Dibango,
 The Soul Makossa Man. Soul left Cameroon for Nigeria to play with
 Jerry Cooper. He then embarked on a thirteen year recording and
 producing career that took him to such world class studios as EMI,
 DECCA, Phonodisk, RecordDisk, Satellite, and TABANSI. After touring
 with Sonny Okusons for five years, Soul came to the United States
 looking for new challenges.  Residing in the East Bay, Soul plays for
 many international and local artists that make their way through the
 Bay Area.  <P> <DT>GUITARS: <DD>Kirk Casey was born and raised in the
San Francisco Bay Area. As a young teenager his band
 opened shows for The Grateful Dead, Santana, and The Sons Of Champlin.
 Studying composition in college, Kirk then continued with Cuban
 Classical guitar. Kirk's interest in world music and jazz lead him to
 study music from many countries of the world. He then studied with
 Miles Davis guitarist Dave Cramer. Currently, Kirk can be heard on
 many national television commercials for such Fortune 500 companies as
 Alamo Car rental, Toyota, GMC trucks, Buick,Yamaha motorcycles, and
 the NBA. Kirk also tours internationally with Jamaican artists Della
 Grant and The Twinkle Brothers.  <P> <DT>DRUMS: <DD>Maanas Itene hails
from Nigeria, West Africa. It took Maanas three years to get to the
United
 States to seek his fortune as a respected musician. Upon arrival to
 the United States the tour previously scheduled for the band was
 canceled. Maanas found himself without work and stranded. He made his
 way to the Bay Area, and now tours with KOTOJA, West African High Life
 Band, and Inka Inka. Groups that Maanas has formerly played with in
 Nigeria include Liberty Loverboy, Victor Suuku, Isaac Black, King
 Walla Man, and Mandators.  <P> <DT>KEYBOARDS: <DD> Jonathan Ridpath
has been playing for over thirty years. He studied at the Berklee
School of
 Music and the New England Conservatory. After his schooling, Jonathan
 then toured along the East Coast, and has played at Tanglewood on
 several occasions. Jonathan moved to San Francisco in 1976 and began
 teaching classical piano. Jonathan recently released a solo EP, titled
 Reflections.<P>

With the release of their self-titled debut album, on Splash
International Records, <B>Challenge</B> proves to be a natural to shape
melodic rock of today. The CD is packed with emotion laden vocals,
catchy guitars and most of all, memorable songs.<P>

<B>Challenge</B> is <B>Arno Verstappen</B> on guitar and <B>Allison
Lindsay</B> on vocals. With the help of fellow musicians and friends,
who appear on this first offering, this duo is a force to be reckoned
with.<P>

Arno emphasizes that their goal is to make music which is less fad
oriented.  ""People have a hard time classifying our music because it's
melodic, yet modern.  Lately people seem to think that in order to be
current, music has to be alternative or grunge. It's interesting, then,
to note the current popularity of numerous melodic and classic rock
bands. Since their songs have a timeless nature, they haven't had to
jump on any trends to enjoy continued success. A position we want to be
in.<P>

While few female singers have had long lasting, enduring careers,
Allison feels the tide is turning, ""Artists like Melissa Etheridge and
Bonnie Raitt are paving the way for women with strong melodies and
honest emotional vocals. It's time for us to cut out the gimmicks and
get back to strong vocal lines and great songs.""<P>

The two first met in Hollywood in 1991, when Amo was auditioning to
find the singer that could bring life to his music. Originally from
Holland, Arno came to Los Angeles in 1989 to study at GIT (Guitar
Institute of Technology). After graduation, he decided to stay in town
to form a band. ""There are a lot more opportunities in Los Angeles. In
Holland, the rock scene is very small,"" Arno clarifies. ""Few bands from
there, with the notable exception of Golden Earring (who have been a
great inspiration), are able to make a comfortable living out of
playing music.""<P>

Coming from opposite sides of the Atlantic exposed the two musicians to
different styles of music. How does that influence the band? ""Arno grew
up listening to the great European rock guitarists. Guys with lots of
feel and personality,"" explains Allison. ""My influence has come from
the dynamics of American singers. You could say we are now able to
incorporate the best of both worlds into our own music.""<P>

As for lyrical content, the band touches on matters of the heart as
well as more serious topics. Allison elaborates, ""Everyone can find
themselves in a love song but we also like to address other matters
that inspire and concern us. Such as the ups and downs that present
themselves in everyday life. ""<P>

Next to being the voice for <B>Challenge</B>, Allison is gaining
notoriety by teaching at Sabine Institute (for Vocal Strengthening and
Development) in Los Angeles.  Sabine Institute (established by renowned
vocal coach Elizabeth Sabine) is famous for coaching many of rocks
brightest stars including Axl Rose, Dave Mustaine, Brian Howe (Bad
Co.). The Institute is currently branching out by bringing it's
powerful technique to Japan, Australia and Italy.<P>

The band has every reason to be confident about the road ahead. ""We
know the time is right for us,"" stresses Amo. ""Alternative and grunge
have clearly textured the 90's with their realistic depictions of the
life styles of today's youth.  However, history shows us that music
trends tend to move in waves and Challenge will be on the crest of the
rising tide of new melodic rock.""<P>

With the release of their self-titled debut album, on SplashInternational Records, __Challenge__ proves to be a natural to shapemelodic rock of today. The CD is packed with emotion laden vocals,catchy guitars and most of all, memorable songs.

__Challenge__ is __Arno Verstappen__ on guitar and __AllisonLindsay__ on vocals. With the help of fellow musicians and friends,who appear on this first offering, this duo is a force to be reckonedwith.

Arno emphasizes that their goal is to make music which is less fadoriented. ""People have a hard time classifying our music because it'smelodic, yet modern. Lately people seem to think that in order to becurrent, music has to be alternative or grunge. It's interesting, then,to note the current popularity of numerous melodic and classic rockbands. Since their songs have a timeless nature, they haven't had tojump on any trends to enjoy continued success. A position we want to bein.

While few female singers have had long lasting, enduring careers,Allison feels the tide is turning, ""Artists like Melissa Etheridge andBonnie Raitt are paving the way for women with strong melodies andhonest emotional vocals. It's time for us to cut out the gimmicks andget back to strong vocal lines and great songs.""

The two first met in Hollywood in 1991, when Amo was auditioning tofind the singer that could bring life to his music. Originally fromHolland, Arno came to Los Angeles in 1989 to study at GIT (GuitarInstitute of Technology). After graduation, he decided to stay in townto form a band. ""There are a lot more opportunities in Los Angeles. InHolland, the rock scene is very small,"" Arno clarifies. ""Few bands fromthere, with the notable exception of Golden Earring (who have been agreat inspiration), are able to make a comfortable living out ofplaying music.""

Coming from opposite sides of the Atlantic exposed the two musicians todifferent styles of music. How does that influence the band? ""Arno grewup listening to the great European rock guitarists. Guys with lots offeel and personality,"" explains Allison. ""My influence has come fromthe dynamics of American singers. You could say we are now able toincorporate the best of both worlds into our own music.""

As for lyrical content, the band touches on matters of the heart aswell as more serious topics. Allison elaborates, ""Everyone can findthemselves in a love song but we also like to address other mattersthat inspire and concern us. Such as the ups and downs that presentthemselves in everyday life. ""

Next to being the voice for __Challenge__, Allison is gainingnotoriety by teaching at Sabine Institute (for Vocal Strengthening andDevelopment) in Los Angeles. Sabine Institute (established by renownedvocal coach Elizabeth Sabine) is famous for coaching many of rocksbrightest stars including Axl Rose, Dave Mustaine, Brian Howe (BadCo.). The Institute is currently branching out by bringing it'spowerful technique to Japan, Australia and Italy.

The band has every reason to be confident about the road ahead. ""Weknow the time is right for us,"" stresses Amo. ""Alternative and grungehave clearly textured the 90's with their realistic depictions of thelife styles of today's youth. However, history shows us that musictrends tend to move in waves and Challenge will be on the crest of therising tide of new melodic rock.""

              <LI>Blair Barnette: Vocals, Bass, Guitar
              <LI>Bill Bartling:  Vocals, Guitar, Mandolin, Lyrics

Redbug hatched about three years ago when Bill started playing a solo acoustic gig after leaving a six year tenure with Central Florida's mid-1980's trend-setters, Braille Closet (of which Erik was also a member).  After three independent releases on the Figurehead label, he felt that it was time to focus on writing lyrics and music that was a little more raw and a little less serious than what Braille Closet was doing.<P>  

In early 1993, Bill started the Canned Corn label.  The first release in Spring of 1993 was Redbug's ""Blue Light Special"" b/w ""Downtown"" 7-inch.  The single received good airplay in a few markets and none in a lot.  Redbug played a few shows with various members: drummer Brian Maguire (currently with Jacksonville's Dave Ronan and the Hootowls) and bassist Andrew Dalio (also of Disco Biscuit).  Blair had been working on a solo
project and was recruited to sing on the record and play bass on
a mini-tour since Andrew's other band keeps him real busy. <P>

The session for the current album, ""No Muffins For Shadow!,"" started as a session for another 7-inch.  Engineer Mark Ignoffo had worked with Smashing Pumpkins in their early days, and the band was impressed with a lot of the music coming out of his studio, Reel Time.  Mark didn't know what to think of Redbug at first.  The band didn't care.  They just wanted to take advantage of his 20 hours for $500.00 special.  Two of the songs on the album, ""Hush Puppy"" and ""Steely Cowsdell,"" were improvisational jams that ended up on the record.  Also included on the C.D. are wacky versions of Deep Purple's ""Highway Star"" and Pearl Jam's ""Black.""  ""Blue Light Special"" and ""Downtown"" were remixed and included on the disc also.  ""Astro-Manta-Ray"" is a tribute to one of the band's faves, Man or Astro-Man.  The song ""Funky Nassau"" available here is a eulogy to our now defunct bowling league, Crush Crush Crush. <P>
 
Redbug's music was described in Minneapolis' YOUR FLESH as ""proficient country-dork spoo.""  Charlotte's THE INDIE FILE described them as ""They Might Be Giants with some real talent.""
The bands influences range from The Outlaws and Buck Owens to the B-52's and X.  They prefer not to be categorized, but if need be, call 'em cow-dork-punk.  <P>

Every Tuesday night they come from all around.<BR>
They all got names on their shirts.<BR>
Passin' round the hat again for someone's ailing heart<BR>
Does anybody know if it's legit.<BR>
Looking forward to this night, Looking forward to a Life.<BR>
Just can't wait for Tuesday night, In Nassau, Funky Nassau.<P>

This one's not out in the ocean.  It's in somebody's tar,<BR>
Scattered there like flamingos in the yard.<BR>
Allured like flies to the aroma of some rot<BR>
To the shed they put up on that spot.<BR>
Looking forward to this night, Looking forward to a Life.<BR>
Just can't wait for Tuesday night, In Nassau, Funky Nassau.<P>

No this song is not a cover of something you may have heard<BR>
By The Beginning Of The End.<BR>
It's about a guy who's got his number on his shirt<BR>
How many times that he has been.<BR>
Looking forward to this night, Looking forward to a Life.<BR>
Just can't wait for Tuesday night, In Nassau, Funky Nassau.<P>

What's that there thing that you got strapped on to your wrist?<BR>
It must help you hold it straight.<BR>
Cuz the more you use it the better you must get, and once you start you get hooked on it.<BR>
Looking forward to this night, Looking forward to a Life.<BR>
Just can't wait for Tuesday night, In Nassau, Funky Nassau.<BR>
In Nassau, Funky Nassau. In Nassau, Funky Nassau.<P>

Two of the songs on the album, ""Hush Puppy"" and ""Steely Cowsdell,"" were improvisational jams that ended up on the record. Also included on the C.D. are wacky versions of Deep Purple's ""Highway Star"" and Pearl Jam's ""Black."" ""Blue Light Special"" and ""Downtown"" were remixed and included on the disc also. ""Astro-Manta-Ray"" is a tribute to one of the band's faves, Man or Astro-Man. The song ""Funky Nassau"" available here is a eulogy to our now defunct bowling league, Crush Crush Crush. 

 Redbug's music was described in Minneapolis' YOUR FLESH as ""proficient country-dork spoo."" Charlotte's THE INDIE FILE described them as ""They Might Be Giants with some real talent.""The bands influences range from The Outlaws and Buck Owens to the B-52's and X. They prefer not to be categorized, but if need be, call 'em cow-dork-punk.

Every Tuesday night they come from all around.  
They all got names on their shirts.  
Passin' round the hat again for someone's ailing heart  
Does anybody know if it's legit.  
Looking forward to this night, Looking forward to a Life.  
Just can't wait for Tuesday night, In Nassau, Funky Nassau.

This one's not out in the ocean. It's in somebody's tar,  
Scattered there like flamingos in the yard.  
Allured like flies to the aroma of some rot  
To the shed they put up on that spot.  
Looking forward to this night, Looking forward to a Life.  
Just can't wait for Tuesday night, In Nassau, Funky Nassau.

No this song is not a cover of something you may have heard  
By The Beginning Of The End.  
It's about a guy who's got his number on his shirt  
How many times that he has been.  
Looking forward to this night, Looking forward to a Life.  
Just can't wait for Tuesday night, In Nassau, Funky Nassau.

What's that there thing that you got strapped on to your wrist?  
It must help you hold it straight.  
Cuz the more you use it the better you must get, and once you start you get hooked on it.  
Looking forward to this night, Looking forward to a Life.  
Just can't wait for Tuesday night, In Nassau, Funky Nassau.  
In Nassau, Funky Nassau. In Nassau, Funky Nassau.

<h3>PORKY PIG PEOPLE - Song #1</h3>

late last night my god came from the sky<br>
a shadowy spirit taking me away<br>
and all my friends come and say goodbye<br>
oh, lying there solid, I didn't have much to say<p>

I'll miss the sun, I'll miss the stars at night<br>
they'll miss my love and all my gambling ways<br>
hey, give me one more chance<br>
and I'll try and make it right<br>
I'll put my last two bucks on a bid for yesterday<p>

oh, yesterday<br>
all my troubles seemed so far away<br>
now it looks as though they're here...<p>

I see your face and I want you tonight<br>
It's not just love I'm looking for<br>
I died this death and now I'm bored<br>
I always hoped for something more<p>

my friend at the zoo says the monkeys all<br>
stare into space<br>
the jaguar paces, the elephant<br>
sleeps on it's side<br>
the porky pig people walk in<br>
and are drawn to a look on a face<br>
that's so frighteningly similar<br>
to a feeling we all keep inside<p>

porky pig people...porky pig<br>
porky pig people...porky pig<p>
<p>


<h3>CRYPTIC TORTURE - Song #2</h3>

20 years of cryptic torture<br>
vomiting in front of friends<br>
wasting time gathering fortunes<br>
that you never get the chance to spend<p>
		
the patient upon learning<br>
he's no longer dying<br>
felt guilty for asking<br>
someone to forgive him<p>

<p>


<h3>EMPTY POCKETS - Song #3</h3>

I'm picking at an empty pocket<br>
could be the richest man in the world<br>
he'd like to see through empty sockets<br>
and there ain't nothin' left in this world<p>

make no mistake about it<br>
you will be riding on this train<br>
could take you climbing up a mountain<br>
or leave you waiting in the rain<br>
where angels fall from dark clouds<br>
into the doubting crowd<p>

I once knew a man<br>
he wrote his story down in pencil<br>
and I said 'be careful where you store your soul,<br>
because someone will erase it'<br>
make no mistake about it<br>
this is not a perfect world<p>

I'm picking from an empty pocket<br>
I'm picking from an empty pocket<br>
I'm picking from an empty pocket<br>
could be the richest man...the richest man<br>
and angels fall from dark clouds<br>
into the doubting crowd<br>
angels fall from dark clouds<br>
into the doubting crowd<p>

Oh world, our world<p>

ABOUT NO WINTER...



No Winter was born in the Fall of 1979 in Aptos, California as a quartet. After stormy beginnings,
 the dust cleared and a tight, enduring trio (Robert, Jim and Dave) emerged called AURORA BOREALIS.
 Early original music had wide influences and took shape in arrangements which balanced song with intricate
 instrumental passages. As the band began to perform, numerous cover tunes crossing most musical 
boundaries (From Alabamas to Zeppelins) were added to the repertoire. This helped to keep a ride range 
of rooms filled, dancing, happy and intact. Always between the covers lurked the original
songs.<P>
 
Throughout the years the band evolved, mutated, went into oblivion and returned from oblivion,
leading to the current project - an eight song CD/Cassette. This was produced with two living in Northern
 California and the other in Southern California. Three of these songs are showcased here and the others 
are:<BR>													
<I>Haven't I Cried Enough</I><BR>							
<I>Queen of the Rodeo</I><BR> 
<I>In Heaven</I><BR>
<I>I need some Lovin'</I><BR>
<I>Message to the stars</I><P>

No Winter perpetually looks for musical/recording/exposure/performance
opportunities.  If you would like to contact us or order the current
songs on CD or cassette, please call <B>1-800-99SUCCess (997-8223).</B><P>

<h1>Penelope Houston</h1>

At the age of 19, <b>Penelope Houston</b> founded what Greil 
Marcus called ""San Francisco's best punk band"" -- The Avengers. 
Penelope was heralded as the ""archetypal indomitable rock 'n' 
roll woman and her band dubbed ""a major national musical asset"" 
by <i>The New Touser Press Record Guide</i>.<p>

Time matured her music; hard-edged noise became intricate melody, 
and raw anger became transformed into a bittersweet awareness 
of the human condition. Penelope was drawn to the evocative and 
immediate nature of acoustic instruments. In expanding the 
dimensions of her core sound, she added bandoneon, cello, 
accordion, soprano and bass clarinet, cornet, French horn, 
melodica and autoharp. Her work has evolved in 
terms of intimacy and depth of emotion, but she has lost none of 
the fierce intelligence that powered the music of the Avengers.<p>

Time matured her music; hard-edged noise became intricate melody, and raw anger became transformed into a bittersweet awareness of the human condition. Penelope was drawn to the evocative and immediate nature of acoustic instruments. In expanding the dimensions of her core sound, she added bandoneon, cello, accordion, soprano and bass clarinet, cornet, French horn, melodica and autoharp. Her work has evolved in terms of intimacy and depth of emotion, but she has lost none of the fierce intelligence that powered the music of the Avengers.

<CENTER> <h1>EL SOB</h1> </CENTER>



	With their vocal-oriented alternative pop sound, El Sob blends
	a mix of acoustic instruments, varied percussion and winning
	harmonies, setting them against the hard-edged songwriting of
	Bruce Rayburn. Active in the San Francisco music scene since
	the post-punk explosion of the mid-80's, both Rayburn and
	bassist Sally Engelfried comprised two-thirds of the folk-punk
	band Yo, who delighted audiences with their three independently
	released albums on Deadbeat and Enigma Records.<P>

	Band member Christine Wall brings to the band sweet-tinged
	vocal harmonies which made her contributions to the last two
	Chris Isaak records (including the hit ""Wicked Game"") so
	memorable.<P>

	Violinist John Tenney is a veteran of stage and record whose
	solid musicianship has been appreciated by the likes of XTC,
	Van Morrison, and Frank Sinatra, with whom he has played.<P>

	Together El Sob's quirky mix of stark yet dense lyrics and
	sweet and brooding music comprises the unique sounds you will
	hear on this tape.<P>

<CENTER> <h3><I>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SONG</I></h3>

<H4>""Skin a Cat"" (2:55 minutes)</H4><BR> </CENTER> ""Skin a Cat"" layers
nonsense lyrics and nursery rhymes in a catchy pop commentary on
sameness in our society. Combined with the unusual
instrumention--squeaky pork chop, gargling, and animal noises--this
discourse makes ""Skin a Cat"" one of El Sob's most popular live
tunes.<P>


<h3>LYRICS</h3>

Hey diddle the cat and the fiddle<BR> Stick it out on Chicken
Little<BR> Lucy in the Sky and the Cat in the Hat<BR> Don't waste your
time on things like that<P>

I ain't nothing like you<BR> I ain't nothing like you<P>

There's more than one way to skin a cat<BR> I live till I die and I
can't come back<BR> Koo koo ca choo and the joke's on you<BR> Laugh in
their face 'cause the things they do<P>

I ain't nothing like you<BR> I ain't nothing like you<P>

Do it like me, do it like me<BR> Do it like me<BR> It's better like
me!<P>

Up in the sky with a thousand eyes<BR> Everyone's looking for love at
first sight<BR> There's more than one way to skin a cat<BR> I live till
I die and I can't come back<P>

I ain't nothing like you<BR> I ain't nothing like you<P>

Be more like me, be more like me<BR> Be more like me<BR> It's better
like me!<P>


<h3>OTHER INFO (because we don't have any press reviews!)</h3>


<B>El Sob...and Stuff</B><P>

Folk-roots rockers El Sob coined the term ""Stuff Band"" to describe
themselves because ""we're not afraid to play anything that might come
our way while shopping at Thrift Town,"" says Christine Wall, who has
been known to balance a cowbell, a glass of water for gargling, and a
dog toy during the course of one song.<P>
	""I used to play a regular electric bass,"" adds Sally
	Engelfried, ""but I found it too limiting, so in searching for
	the right sound I had one made for me."" The resulting
	one-of-a-kind instrument is striking in its piano-like
	resonance.<P> ""I'm devoted to El Sob because this is the only
	band that lets me shake my tookus in public,"" comments John
	Tenney, who sometimes takes a turn at tambourine and kazoo, in
	addition to his specialties of violin and mandolin.<P> Bruce
	Rayburn, whose stuff most often comes from down-and-out
	cousins, has been known to write songs about stuff and his
	cousins. ""I got Christine's dumbek for her from an old
	girlfriend who owed me,"" says Rayburn gleefully.<P>

<center> <h1>EL SOB</h1> </center>

	With their vocal-oriented alternative pop sound, El Sob blends
	a mix of acoustic instruments, varied percussion and winning
	harmonies, setting them against the hard-edged songwriting of
	Bruce Rayburn. Active in the San Francisco music scene since
	the post-punk explosion of the mid-80's, both Rayburn and
	bassist Sally Engelfried comprised two-thirds of the folk-punk
	band Yo, who delighted audiences with their three independently
	released albums on Deadbeat and Enigma Records.

	Band member Christine Wall brings to the band sweet-tinged	vocal harmonies which made her contributions to the last two	Chris Isaak records (including the hit ""Wicked Game"") so	memorable.

	Violinist John Tenney is a veteran of stage and record whose	solid musicianship has been appreciated by the likes of XTC,	Van Morrison, and Frank Sinatra, with whom he has played.

	Together El Sob's quirky mix of stark yet dense lyrics and	sweet and brooding music comprises the unique sounds you will	hear on this tape.

<center> <h3><i>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SONG</i></h3>
<h4>""Skin a Cat"" (2:55 minutes)</h4><br/> </center>

 ""Skin a Cat"" layersnonsense lyrics and nursery rhymes in a catchy pop commentary onsameness in our society. Combined with the unusualinstrumention--squeaky pork chop, gargling, and animal noises--thisdiscourse makes ""Skin a Cat"" one of El Sob's most popular livetunes.

### LYRICS

Hey diddle the cat and the fiddle  
 Stick it out on ChickenLittle  
 Lucy in the Sky and the Cat in the Hat  
 Don't waste yourtime on things like that

I ain't nothing like you  
 I ain't nothing like you

There's more than one way to skin a cat  
 I live till I die and Ican't come back  
 Koo koo ca choo and the joke's on you  
 Laugh intheir face 'cause the things they do

I ain't nothing like you  
 I ain't nothing like you

Do it like me, do it like me  
 Do it like me  
 It's better likeme!

Up in the sky with a thousand eyes  
 Everyone's looking for love atfirst sight  
 There's more than one way to skin a cat  
 I live tillI die and I can't come back

I ain't nothing like you  
 I ain't nothing like you

Be more like me, be more like me  
 Be more like me  
 It's betterlike me!

### OTHER INFO (because we don't have any press reviews!)

__El Sob...and Stuff__

Folk-roots rockers El Sob coined the term ""Stuff Band"" to describethemselves because ""we're not afraid to play anything that might comeour way while shopping at Thrift Town,"" says Christine Wall, who hasbeen known to balance a cowbell, a glass of water for gargling, and adog toy during the course of one song.

	""I used to play a regular electric bass,"" adds Sally	Engelfried, ""but I found it too limiting, so in searching for	the right sound I had one made for me."" The resulting	one-of-a-kind instrument is striking in its piano-like	resonance.

 ""I'm devoted to El Sob because this is the only	band that lets me shake my tookus in public,"" comments John	Tenney, who sometimes takes a turn at tambourine and kazoo, in	addition to his specialties of violin and mandolin.

 Bruce	Rayburn, whose stuff most often comes from down-and-out	cousins, has been known to write songs about stuff and his	cousins. ""I got Christine's dumbek for her from an old	girlfriend who owed me,"" says Rayburn gleefully.

<P>
<B>DOUG ROBERTSON</B><BR>
Lyrics, Vocals On All Raping Parts
<P>
Joshua Mottley, (Josh) Is a twenty-one year old Scottsdale, 
Arizona resident  wlth  a  destiny.  Since
hls early teens, Josh has had a dream to conquer 
the realms of musicology.  From  writirig  song  lyrics,  to
composing music to fit them to, Josh was never told he  
couldn't  do  it.  In  his  twenty-one  years  he  has
reveled to the heights of his dream, mastering the art 
of playing several musical instruments, writing  heart
rendering lyrics, and arranging  music  that  wlll  set  
the  hardest  soul  to  dancing.  To  make  the  cycle
complete, Josh has delved into the other side of the 
board and  become  a  prolific  producer  as  well.  With
two completed albums, 'Lifetimes' (Rock alternative) 
with his 'Nowhere Dreamer' band,  and  as  a  Soloist  on
the  album  'Venus  Butterfly' -'Tao  of  lust',  (Techno  
Dance,)  Josh  Mottley,  and  long  time  friend  Doug
Robertson have brought Adult Comedy Rap to the list of 
his ever growing  repertoire  of  original  productions
wlth their newest endeavor, '<B>NASTY WABBIT</B>.' Although the  
finishing  touches  have  yet  to  be  put  on  this
humorous demo, the two have gotten off to a great start 
wlth 'Naked Naked' and 'Fire In The Hole.'
<P>
Doug Robertsom affectionately known as 'The Party  Animal'  
by  Josh  and  their  friends,  was  born
and raised In Grand Rapids,  Michigan  on  January  the  
8th.  1971.  Doug  played  Soccer  for  East  Grand
Rapids High, and  was  on  the  All  State  Conference  
team  in  high  school.  In  1990  Doug  relocated  to
Scottsdale. Arizona where he met Josh when his brother  
Don,  joined  the  'Nowhere  Dreamer  Band'  led  by
Mottley.
<P>
Doug, the ""cut up,"" always making the others laugh with 
his raw humor and  original  Rapping  lyrics
caught the ear of Mottley. Josh, being ever on  the  look 
 out  for  something  unique  musically  to  conquer,
recognized Doug's talent and teamed with Robertson to bring 
life to the  down  home  humor  of  the  guy  from
Grand Rapids.
<P>
Mottley, by now an old pro to the music industry, took 'Rappin' 
Doug'  Into  the  studio  to  produce
his first encounter into the music field. Doug took to the 
microphone like a duck takes to water.  Before  all
the scratch vocals were laid for the  music,  Doug  could  
be  heard  through  the  speakers  calling  to  the
engineer, 'Hey Rog, roll the damn tape.'
<P>
Doug has completed the first two songs  on  the  demo  
under  the  dlrection  of  Mottley  who  wrote
and arranged the music and also sang the back ground 
parts of the songs,  'Naked  Naked'  and  'Fire  In  The
Hole;' both of which were lyrically written by Robertson. 
When ask where  he  gets  hls  rapping  talent  Doug
kindly replies, 'I'm a black man living in a white mans body.'
<P>         
While waiting to complete the 'Nasty Wabbit' album, Doug 
can be  found  working  as  a  waiter  in  a
local Scottsdale restaurant.  When  not  working  or  
rappin',  Doug  attends  Scottsdale  Community  College,
where he is majoring in Business Administration. Doug has 
a  great  sense  of  humor  behind  the  microphone,
and with the combined talents of both mem they are sure 
to  take  'NASTY  WABBIT'  to  the  upper  reaches  of
musical acclaim.

<center><b>JOSHUA MOTTLEY</b><br/>
Vocals, Musicial Arrangements, Production
<p>
<b>DOUG ROBERTSON</b><br/>
Lyrics, Vocals On All Raping Parts
<p>
Joshua Mottley, (Josh) Is a twenty-one year old Scottsdale, 
Arizona resident  wlth  a  destiny.  Since
hls early teens, Josh has had a dream to conquer 
the realms of musicology.  From  writirig  song  lyrics,  to
composing music to fit them to, Josh was never told he  
couldn't  do  it.  In  his  twenty-one  years  he  has
reveled to the heights of his dream, mastering the art 
of playing several musical instruments, writing  heart
rendering lyrics, and arranging  music  that  wlll  set  
the  hardest  soul  to  dancing.  To  make  the  cycle
complete, Josh has delved into the other side of the 
board and  become  a  prolific  producer  as  well.  With
two completed albums, 'Lifetimes' (Rock alternative) 
with his 'Nowhere Dreamer' band,  and  as  a  Soloist  on
the  album  'Venus  Butterfly' -'Tao  of  lust',  (Techno  
Dance,)  Josh  Mottley,  and  long  time  friend  Doug
Robertson have brought Adult Comedy Rap to the list of 
his ever growing  repertoire  of  original  productions
wlth their newest endeavor, '<b>NASTY WABBIT</b>.' Although the  
finishing  touches  have  yet  to  be  put  on  this
humorous demo, the two have gotten off to a great start 
wlth 'Naked Naked' and 'Fire In The Hole.'
<p>
Doug Robertsom affectionately known as 'The Party  Animal'  
by  Josh  and  their  friends,  was  born
and raised In Grand Rapids,  Michigan  on  January  the  
8th.  1971.  Doug  played  Soccer  for  East  Grand
Rapids High, and  was  on  the  All  State  Conference  
team  in  high  school.  In  1990  Doug  relocated  to
Scottsdale. Arizona where he met Josh when his brother  
Don,  joined  the  'Nowhere  Dreamer  Band'  led  by
Mottley.
<p>
Doug, the ""cut up,"" always making the others laugh with 
his raw humor and  original  Rapping  lyrics
caught the ear of Mottley. Josh, being ever on  the  look 
 out  for  something  unique  musically  to  conquer,
recognized Doug's talent and teamed with Robertson to bring 
life to the  down  home  humor  of  the  guy  from
Grand Rapids.
<p>
Mottley, by now an old pro to the music industry, took 'Rappin' 
Doug'  Into  the  studio  to  produce
his first encounter into the music field. Doug took to the 
microphone like a duck takes to water.  Before  all
the scratch vocals were laid for the  music,  Doug  could  
be  heard  through  the  speakers  calling  to  the
engineer, 'Hey Rog, roll the damn tape.'
<p>
Doug has completed the first two songs  on  the  demo  
under  the  dlrection  of  Mottley  who  wrote
and arranged the music and also sang the back ground 
parts of the songs,  'Naked  Naked'  and  'Fire  In  The
Hole;' both of which were lyrically written by Robertson. 
When ask where  he  gets  hls  rapping  talent  Doug
kindly replies, 'I'm a black man living in a white mans body.'
<p>         
While waiting to complete the 'Nasty Wabbit' album, Doug 
can be  found  working  as  a  waiter  in  a
local Scottsdale restaurant.  When  not  working  or  
rappin',  Doug  attends  Scottsdale  Community  College,
where he is majoring in Business Administration. Doug has 
a  great  sense  of  humor  behind  the  microphone,
and with the combined talents of both mem they are sure 
to  take  'NASTY  WABBIT'  to  the  upper  reaches  of
musical acclaim.

<b><h2>Looking Glass</h2></b>
<i><b>-The band/The music</b></i><p> 
An avant-garde blending of spoken word lyrics with visually 
evocative, hypnotic music, <b>Looking Glass</b> invites you to share 
emotions that run from jagged to ethereal, futuristic to 
archetypal, slithering to sensual. The spoken word lyrics are 
somewhere between poetry and song lyrics: there are repeated 
elements as there would be in lyrics, but not bound by the 
verse/chorus format. As the material is not read as a poem 
would be, but spoken, the intent is for the listener to be able 
to take away something of what was heard, much as being able to 
remember a song's melody. In a creative blitz, 15 songs have 
been written and recorded from September of 1993 to today. 
KFJC, the radio station at 89.7 FM, is playing material from 
the demo tapes. Other radio stations are in the works.<p>

Area. Soulstice has released Wake-up Call, also independently. 
Formerly, Tom was guitar and keyboard player in the rock group

<b><h2><i>Out Of The Lair</i></h2></b>
<i>The song</i><p>
It's the 1890's. You're in an opium den in England. It's dark, 
smoky and red hued: Blood red walls, dark red tapestries on the 
floor, red velvet sofas along the walls. Whether it's the smoke 
or the effect of the smoke on your mind, it's hard to tell real 
from illusion, pysical from imagined. Lewis Carroll wrote about 
what this feels like in <i>Through The Looking Glass</i>. Enough 
hints? <b>Listen to the song...</b><p>

<H1>CLAN DIAH</CENTER></H1>
To a ground work of massive bass sound, add the drive of stormy, trippy
drums, thick and spicy guitars plus mature, haunting vocals and you
have (with the occasional Celtic bagpipe and penny whistle) <B>Clan Diah</B>.
Emotionally charged and deep in meaning, Clan Diah produces sways from
indie rock to heavier alternative. It's no wonder their appeal to the
college scene keeps growing. Clan Diah is eclectic, yet ironically
maintains a balanced, cohesive sound. They flow through a whole gamut
of styles and sounds, but each song is uncontrived and honest. This
sophisticated approach makes for timeless music. Clan Diah is song
oriented with a communication of both mood and thought. This Cincinnati
based quartet capitalizes on dynamics all through their debut CD ""<I>The
Train Journey North</I>."" If you haven't heard them have a taste and enjoy
the Cincinnati style cookin'.

<P>
<B>About the songs available on IUMA...</B>
<P>
<I>SKY SIGN</I>: This tribute to the unseen fully explores the use of
dynamics. It refers to the sense that we believe in many things not yet
seen, or invisible. We can see the future by study of the past and we
can see the invisible by the results it produces. This song has
interesting changes in time signature and moods. It trips, it flies, it
spirals out of control. What is communication but transfer of ideas and
moods? Words too are invisible and yet still exist.
<P>
<I>MIST COVERED MOUNTAINS</I>: Simply Complicated and sadly beautiful.
Christopher shows off some of his piping abilities on this piece.
Originally composed by an unknown source in the early 1800's, this
piece is sometimes rendered with Gaelic (trad. Scottish language)
lyrics but more often the haunting melody is left alone to tell the
tale of a traveler longing for the mist covered mountains of his home.
This tune was a favorite of the late King George the VI and was played
at his funeral. It was also played at the funeral of President John F.
Kennedy. Highland bagpipes, acoustic guitar, and the distant harmonies
of the whistles will leave an impression.
<P>
<I>SYMBOL OF MY SHAME</I>: Very Emotional! This song demonstrates the winding
melodies and thick guitars. Listen hard and you'll hear Jay's marching
band past. This song is rich in meaning. It refers to the moving irony
of the feast of Christ's last meal. It was caused by man's failure, yet
caused man's redemption. He said it symbolized His death and His blood.
He then gave thanks to God for it and ate it.

HISTORY OF CLAN DIAH
<P>
In Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1991 a few college friends started writing
songs. Clan Diah, as a band started with the stereotypical ritual of
arguing over what to name the band. They settled on ""Clan Diah"" which
is an old Scottish phrase meaning ""the children of God."" This subtle
reference to the divine nature of our humanity came from the Scottish
influence of one of the members, Christopher McLennan, who is a
nationally awarded bagpipe performer. After the name was chosen the
band started playing out at local venues and coffee houses in the
Cincinnati area.
<P>
Over the years the band did some quick recordings of songs for a demo
tape. One song (""Matter of Time"") actually ended up on a nationally
distributed compilation CD. With the confidence built by a very
supportive local fan base, the success of the demo tape, and playing at
a national music festival, the band embarked on its most ambitious
endeavor yet...
<P>
In July of 1994, Clan Diah went into the studio to start recording its
first full length compact disc. This self produced, independently
released, and personally financed album is a statement of the band's
abilities, commitment, and pro-active nature.
<P>
Clan Diah continues today to develop its loyal following. The band is
presently shopping labels to give themselves the freedom to fully
explore their potential. They wish you the best and hope you enjoy
their work. See you on the ""Train Journey North.""

<P>
Christopher is a 22 year old business major at the University of
Cincinnati. From his young formative years he has played piano, violin,
bagpipes, and the penny whistle. He was president of the Sycamore
Orchestra and has won many national competitions on the bagpipes. He
manages two apartment buildings, dabbles in the stock market, and is
pipe major of the Caledonian Pipes and Drums of Cincinnati. He also has
a certain preoccupation with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""Sherlock Homes.""
<P>
<B>JAY HARNISH</B>: Drums, Percussion, Exotic Coffee
<P>
Jay is a 22 year old CAD operator at an engineering firm in Cincinnati.
He has played drums since the age of ten. His eclectic music tastes and
artistic abilities add to the band's persona. Along with being a CAD
operator, Jay is also a talented model maker and is very gifted in the
art of Calligraphy (note the band's logo).
<P>
<B>JEREMY PITTMAN</B>: Bass Guitar
<P>
Jeremy is a 20 year old saltpacker. Yes, you read correctly, he moves
bags of salt. Jeremy has the strongest back in the band. He loves to
play bass. That is all he talks about. We try to distract him but all
he'll do is play bass and work a day job to pay for more bass gear. We
are, however, hopeful that he might actually spend his money on
something else: He's thinking of getting a tattoo.
<P>
<B>KENDALL FAULL</B>: Lead Vocals, Guitar

Dead long jam playing covers of Eddie Money all night wish I was a rock 
star but can't write music 12 bar blues 1-4-5 progression put your hands 
in the air and shake 'em like you just don't care 10 minute see how fast 
I can play guitar solo take off my leather to see my tatoos in yo' face 
hardcore metal from the street swiggin' a forty check my beeper cyber 
punk death rap band.<p>

<B>WRITING TEAM CREATES BOFFO CD AFTER RELEASE FROM 
HOSPITAL FOR CRIMINALLY UNEMPLOYABLE</B></CENTER>

<P>
The  comedy  writing  team  of  <B>Carol  Lee</B>  and  <B>Steve  Sea</B>  
were released  from  the  Washington  State  Hospital  for  the   Criminally
Unemployable today  to  promote  their  new  CD,  <I>Mouthbreather:  Humor
for  the  Totally  Incorrect,  Performed  by  the  Puget  Sound  Bytes</I>.
The pair, who met when the  poles  of  their  portable  IV's  of  
Maintainizine  collided  on  their  way   to   shock   treatment   therapy,
apparently  were  left  to  their  own  comedic  devices  when  the  TV
broke in the day room last week.
<P>
""I've listened to  the  CD  and  have  concluded  that  Frau  Lee
and  Herr  Sea  are  too  sick  for  this  facility,""  said  Chief   of
Psychiatry, Dr.  Sy Cotic.      ""I'd   mistakenly  thought  there   was
hope for full recovery when they no longer insisted upon coming
to meals with their gowns open in  the  front,  but  when  they  didn't
respond to occupational therapy  and  got  on  this  joke  jag,  I  had
to let them go.       We  simply  cannot  tolerate   patients   wasting
valuable materials to make hand  buzzers  and  fake  barf,""  Dr.  Cotic
continued.
<P>
Although  unavailable  for  comment,  ""Lee  and  Sea   vehemently
deny  having  made  the  CD  while  on  the  inside,""  an  unidentified
spokesman said.     ""Actually,  one  day  they  were  so  bored,   they
escaped,  unnoticed,  and  ended-up  at  a  nearby   grange   hall   in
Chimacum,  Washington  where  they  happened  upon  a  bunch  of  other
former patients who  were  attempting  to  improvise  eco-based  comedy
bits for Seattle area  radio  station,  KSER.  Trying  to  turn  topics
as grim as acid rain dripping through  holes  in  the  ozone  into
knee slapping comedy, appealed to the two depressives right  away.
When Sea's old Radio Shack dictation  machine  caught  fire,""  the
spokesman continued, ""the other inmates fled.    But Lee  and  Sea
stuck it out and deeply inhaled the toxic fumes which  became  the
streams of acerbic exhalations that ultimately led  to  the  creation 
of Mouthbreather.    With  no  hope  of  obtaining  corporate
financing, the desperate pair pooled their disability  checks  and
held hostage an innocent sound engineer who did an  award  winning
job of mixing an entire album with the jagged edge of a broken  IV
bottle at his throat.   The result  is  seventy-two  minutes  of
incisive, synapse blistering humor. <I>Mouthbreather: Humor  for  the
Totally Incorrect, Performed by the Puget Sound Bytes</I>. On  CD  and
Cassette.

<b>WRITING TEAM CREATES BOFFO CD AFTER RELEASE FROM 
HOSPITAL FOR CRIMINALLY UNEMPLOYABLE</b></center>

The comedy writing team of __Carol Lee__ and __Steve Sea__ were released from the Washington State Hospital for the CriminallyUnemployable today to promote their new CD, _Mouthbreather: Humorfor the Totally Incorrect, Performed by the Puget Sound Bytes_.The pair, who met when the poles of their portable IV's of Maintainizine collided on their way to shock treatment therapy,apparently were left to their own comedic devices when the TVbroke in the day room last week.

""I've listened to the CD and have concluded that Frau Leeand Herr Sea are too sick for this facility,"" said Chief ofPsychiatry, Dr. Sy Cotic. ""I'd mistakenly thought there washope for full recovery when they no longer insisted upon comingto meals with their gowns open in the front, but when they didn'trespond to occupational therapy and got on this joke jag, I hadto let them go. We simply cannot tolerate patients wastingvaluable materials to make hand buzzers and fake barf,"" Dr. Coticcontinued.

Although unavailable for comment, ""Lee and Sea vehementlydeny having made the CD while on the inside,"" an unidentifiedspokesman said. ""Actually, one day they were so bored, theyescaped, unnoticed, and ended-up at a nearby grange hall inChimacum, Washington where they happened upon a bunch of otherformer patients who were attempting to improvise eco-based comedybits for Seattle area radio station, KSER. Trying to turn topicsas grim as acid rain dripping through holes in the ozone intoknee slapping comedy, appealed to the two depressives right away.When Sea's old Radio Shack dictation machine caught fire,"" thespokesman continued, ""the other inmates fled. But Lee and Seastuck it out and deeply inhaled the toxic fumes which became thestreams of acerbic exhalations that ultimately led to the creation of Mouthbreather. With no hope of obtaining corporatefinancing, the desperate pair pooled their disability checks andheld hostage an innocent sound engineer who did an award winningjob of mixing an entire album with the jagged edge of a broken IVbottle at his throat. The result is seventy-two minutes ofincisive, synapse blistering humor. _Mouthbreather: Humor for theTotally Incorrect, Performed by the Puget Sound Bytes_. On CD andCassette.

    <B> the Elvis Diet</B> is a Chicago based surf punk band. Steve, 
Dave, Kerry and Jack formed the
band as an oasis from the hair metal bands of the late 80's early 90's. Tailspin
Magazine described
their sound as ""twisted punk with a sense of humor"".  Drawing from 80's bands as
the Pixies,
the Plimsouls and the Ramones as influences,<B> the Elvis Diet </B>has formed their own
left of
center punk sound. <B>the Elvis Diet</B> pushes their live shows to extremes, similar to
the kings
eating binges, very extreme.  They frequently can be seen in the Chicagoland
area, either in the
city or the suburbs providing an energy filled show. To their credit they have
two CD's available
for sale. The Debut CD contains the song'l Wanna be a Kennedy', this song is a
humorous bash
of the Kennedy clan and was featured on over 50 college radio stations throughout
the US. The
sound clip song Question Everything and Ground Hog is from the just released
second CD
entitled Gravity Furnace. <B>the Elvis Diet</B> has a mailing list that keeps fellow
dieters updated on
upco@ng shows and current Elvis sightings. All interested are invited to come
join the crowd.
You may contact the band by mail at </B>the Elvis Diet</B>, P.O. Box 4404, Hammond IN
46324 or
E-Mail them at <A HREF=""mailto:SteverGTR@AOL.com"" > SteverGTR@AOL.com </A><P>

<h1>Barbara Manning</h1>

The <i>Village Voice</i> said ""Manning's songs are brooding, 
unflinching, scary, and most utterly believable.... Lou Reed and 
Rosanne Cash rolled into one."" <i>Spin</i> magazine called Barbara's first
album <b><i>Scissors</i></b> one of the best albums of the 
decade. In the <i>Gavin 
Report</i>, musician Robyn Hitchcock named 
<b><i>Scissors</i></b> one of his top ten 
favorites along with albums by Roxy Music, REM, Richard Thompson,
and Elvis Costello. The <i>Village Voice</i> said ""Barbara Manning
can make waves in a sea of sarcasm with introspective pretty songs
about heavy shit. Her voice makes the edge seem like a place to warm
yourself....her Nick Drake dread was cut with punk derision, her
Suzanne Vega lilt was frosted with anxiety and her folky ear was 
full of Wire and the Fall.""<p>

<b><i>Scissors</i></b>, originally released in 1988 on vinyl, was out of print for
several years. As a special bonus, the CD and cassette formats of
<b><i>One Perfect Green Blanket</i></b> includes all ten cuts 
from the <b><i>Scissors</i></b> LP
as well. Guest musicians helping out on the album include Kim 
Osterwalder from Flophouse on cello, Melanie Clarin from Harm Farm on
drums, and Steve Michner from Big Dipper on bass. Barbara has
developed a strong cult following over the past several years with 
her frequent live shows on both coasts. Barabara's music is regularly
heard on college radio across the country. Several cuts from One 
<b><i>Perfect Green Blanket</i></b> were included in the underground film classic
<i>Hippie Porn</i>.<p>

<B>Biographical Information:</B>
<P>
In 1984 Lois LaFond had two of the most gorgeous, talented and
astounding Children on the face of the earth, who were four and five years old. 
She searched high and low, in and out, up and down, by and through, far and wide,
but couldn't find the kind of music she really liked made especially for Children
(like smokin' saxophones and percolatin'percussion). So, being one to do whatever was necessary for those two most gorgeous, talented and
astounding Children on the face of the earth, she decided to put out an album of her own with
Reggae, Salsa, Blues,Ballads, Rock & Roll and African grooves. As she had been in the adult
music scene for some number of years in the Boulder-Denver area, she had access to some of
the greatest musicians to be found anywhere. And, as it worked out, in 1985, she had her third
baby: I AM WHO I AM! This recording put her on the map as one of the premier American
artists making modern music for young Children. At the same time she gathered four of Colorado's
really rockin' players and formed LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES -- one of the early five-piece
bands to hit the road for Kids.
<P>
Now this World Beat sound satisfied those two gorgeous, talented and astounding Children, who also composed many of the songs with LaFond. Soon LaFond found out that
many other Children-- as well as their parents -- were absolutely thrilled with her
recording. People said things like, ""I really don't mind that my Child plays this tape over and over and
over and over and over and over. I really like it, too!"" Reviews poured in from all over the
country from newspapers and magazines, parents and teachers, and -- most importantly -- from Kids.
I AM WHO I AM! became a signature tune which put LaFond in the forefront of composing and
producing songs of self-esteem and diversity -- years before they were the buzzwords of today.
Classrooms started using the music, as did Spinabifida Centers, ARC Centers and Very Special
Arts Festivals around the country.
<P>
Encouraged by the response, LaFond decided to make another record in
1986. And another one in 1987. And another one in 1989. Each recording brought more rave
reviews, positive comments and responses from publications like THE L.A.PARENT, PARENTS'
CHOICE, BILLBOARD MAGAZINE, DOWNBEAT MAGAZINE, GRAMMY MAGAZINE, American Library
Association's BOOKLIST, PRE-K TODAY, MUSIC EDUCATOR'S JOURNAL, SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL, 
Jill Jarnow's ALL EARS, Laurie Sale's GROWING UP WITH MUSIC .. . . In fact, there were so 
many reviews that there was no way to keep track of them anymore!
<P>
LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES' songs were played on RADIO AAHS, WE LIKE KIDS of KTOO, Alaska, 
PICKLEBERRY PIE out of Santa Cruz, WCBS-TV in New York, and on
CONTINENTAL,LUFTHANSA, and DELTA Airlines Children's in-flight programming.
<P>
Of course, people started calling for shows with the ROCKADILES. So they toured their original 
participatory concerts to thousands of Children from New York to Oregon and from                         
Alaska to Florida at places like New York's CENTRAL PARK, HENRY STREET SETTLEMENT, and ST.PETER'S 
CATHEDRAL.
<P>
Then, in 1995, LaFond produced her fifth album, TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN. So now the Rockin' 
ROCKADILES' concerts include songs from this new recording as well as I AM WHO I AM!
and their very popular ONE WORLD.
<P>
Soon LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES will be touring throughout COLORADO and in CHICAGO, 
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, and WASHINGTON, D.C. If you are in these areas, they might just be able to come to your community. You can call HEATHER NOTO at AGENCY
WEST (303-652-3421) to bring ROCKADILES to YOUR town -- wherever you are!!
<P>
One thing Lois LaFond knows for sure is that every Child she gets to meet now is gorgeous,
talented and astounding.

<B>BAND MEMBER LIST:</B>
<P>
LOIS LaFOND & THE ROCKADILES' live show paints a rainbow of words that kids love, messages 
that parents appreciate, and great music that pulls it all together in the World Beat.
<P>
Mother, singer, songwriter, producer, and speaker, <B>LOIS LaFOND</B> spent most of her life in the performance arts of dance, music, mime, and theatre, as well as
teaching. Lois first made her mark in the adult world of music as vocalist and lyricist. She then
brought her varied styles of music to the hearts of Children -- writing, producing, and recording
five albums for Children and their families. Her sophisticated world music enjoys national acclaim
from the L.A. PARENT and PARENTS' CHOICE to BILLBOARD and DOWNBEAT magazines. Her songs
appear on several international airlines and commercial and promotional videos. Her
spoken voice is heard on voice-overs for video and radio productions as well as commercials. She is a
featured speaker at NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN Conferences
and sits on the faculty of THE PEOPLES NETWORK. Her many years of experience in the
disciplines of teaching, music, and the performing arts combine to create the ultimate
in entertainment for the entire family.
<P>
<B>THE PLAYERS:</B>
<P>
Drummer <B>GORDON KENNEDY</B> has been a musical mainstay in the ROCKADILES.
He is featured on all of LaFond's recordings and in her opinion, ""Gordon has
everything: great rhythm, keen ears,and a wild sense of humour."" Kennedy started drumming on 
potato chip cans at 13. Now his styles range from rock to freeform improvisation with his current band,
THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. His drumming credits include, as he says, ""Too many bands to be
significant."" He has opened for TALKING HEADS, THE RAMONES and KING SUNNY ADE. Kennedy says,
""With Children, there are no pretensions. It's just plain fun to work with THE ROCKADILES.""
<P>
Keyboardist <B>REBECCA MARTIN</B> began playing the piano at the age of six,and went on to earn a B.A. in Music and a Masters in Piano Performance and Pedagogy. Her
talent for improvisation is seen in her jazz combo, THE REBECCA MARTIN TRIO, and the big band
PANDAEMONIUM. She is an outstanding classical pianist who performs both solo and
duet. She has taught piano for 21 years, specializing in the Suzuki method for young Children.
Rebecca composed the piano music on LaFond's third tape SOMETHING NEW!
<P>
Bassist <B>CHICO MEIRA</B> also plays guitar, sings and composes. He began studying guitar as an eight year old child in Rio de Janeiro. The traditional music of Brazil
which he brings to the band encompasses Samba, Bossa Nova, Chorinho, and African as well as
Brazilian rhythms. He played in many rock bands in his native country and was the major force behind
the band PAO BRASIL providing both classical guitar and vocals. Currently, in addition to
ROCKADILES, he plays bass and percussion with CONGUEROS DEL ALMA while working as a full time
bio-engineer.
<P>
Saxophonist <B>MARK HARRIS</B> has played everything from what he calls ""way-avante-honk-and-
squeak music"" to the Colorado Symphony. Whatever the style, his preference is to play original
music. His favorite style is world beat dance music with his band, MONKEY SIREN. Mark has
played for shows with Bob Hope, Joe Williams, The Temptations, and Diane Schuur. He teaches
sax at Metro State College of Denver and has appeared as a featured classical soloist with their
wind ensemble. He performs on many recordings including those of Ron Miles, Fred Hess, and
Janet Feder. He says, ""Kids are swell.""
<P>
<B>MARK McCOIN</B> has played drums and percussion for 25 years gaining a national reputation for his musical scoring, art installations, and sound designs across the
country. He has performed in America, Indonesia and Singapore. Mark has composed numerous theatre
and dance scores for the DENVER CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS and the DAVID TAYLOR
DANCE COMPANY. He founded the DENVER GAMELAN and was co-producer of the highly successful NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO series, TERRA INFIRMA. Mark has composed numerous
original soundscapes.

<B>Brief Description of the songs</B>
<P>
""Alliteration Sensation"" was a blast to make. I just started thinking of the craziest combinations of words that started with the same letter. I like to pass on to kids
some of what are called ""figures of speech"" in the English language, and this one is always a
lot of fun. You can make up your own alliterations -- try any letter.
<P>
""One World"" originated as a song for adult audiences. Its groove has an mbaganga influence from South Africa, also called ""township jive."" When recording my
Children's album, I thought ""One World"" would be a great choice to include for kids since it always
got a such a hearty response from dancing adults. I try not to do any less for kids than I
do for adults.

TURNING IT UPSIDE DOWN (LL-05c and LL-05cd) (Song ""Alliteration
Sensation"" included online)
<P>
In this hot new release, LaFond does turn it all upside down. Continuing in her tradition of 
cutting edge music, this new album replaces her big band sound with the essentials of music:
vocals and percussion. LaFond has turned to an exciting array of over 40 percussion instruments
from around the world including the Australian Didgeridoo, the Brazilian Berimbau and the
American Washboard -- and everything in between. Singing of everything from numbers in three
languages to a changeable creature named Zuppie, this recording also includes a parade, movement songs and a 5-minute relaxation process.
<P>
PLUS, based on LaFond's highly successful workshop: ""USING MUSIC IN THE CLASSROOM: YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BEETHOVEN,"" she has compiled a manual of hands-on
ideas for Parents and Teachers to use the songs to teach all the disciplines including
Language, Math, Art, Imagination, and more. Hailed by teachers and parents and, especially, kids. Geared
for the Child 4-7.

for adults, ORCHESTRA KING MAMA. This sound is captured on ONE WORLD, which includes African/Caribbean-influenced music styles such as soca and mbaganga, as well as blues,
gospel, jazz, klezmer,reggae, and ballads. Geared for the Child of all ages. This percolating
music will get the whole family moving and singing together from the first tune!

Kennedy started drumming on potato chip cans at 13. Now his styles range from rock to freeform improvisation with his current band,THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. His drumming credits include, as he says, ""Too many bands to besignificant."" He has opened for TALKING HEADS, THE RAMONES and KING SUNNY ADE. Kennedy says,""With Children, there are no pretensions. It's just plain fun to work with THE ROCKADILES.""

__Brief Description of the songs__

""Alliteration Sensation"" was a blast to make. I just started thinking of the craziest combinations of words that started with the same letter. I like to pass on to kidssome of what are called ""figures of speech"" in the English language, and this one is always alot of fun. You can make up your own alliterations -- try any letter.

""One World"" originated as a song for adult audiences. Its groove has an mbaganga influence from South Africa, also called ""township jive."" When recording myChildren's album, I thought ""One World"" would be a great choice to include for kids since it alwaysgot a such a hearty response from dancing adults. I try not to do any less for kids than Ido for adults.

<h2>
<B>nada</B> <I>awkward y borracho core del todo</I> <P>
</H2>

nada combines heavy beats, cynical lyrics and unearthly sounds with
intricate percussion and intense guitar work to create a new listening
experience. <P>

<I>'awkward y borracho core del todo'</I>, nada's premiere release,
opens with eerie samples, deep kick drum and a noisey guitar crescendo
in ""apopolysp."" The fast guitar and techno schizophrenia of ""x/l/r flood
o.d."" then collapses into the mystical wanderings of ""ignatio chloride
the balding."" ""the revolutionary om"" uses ambient soundscapes to slowly
build into an explosive ending. The grinding guitars and scraping metal
percussion of ""idiot's planet"" lead into the hallucinogenic crawl of
""tsunami fungus."" ""excruciate"" combines a thumping subsonic kick with
extensive guitar work, while the sinuous bass and drum sounds of ""string
(premonition v)"" blend together for a more Eastern flavor. ""afraid""
winds through tribal rhythms and crunchy guitars featuring a strange
vocal melody which by the end sets the mood for ""near.""
""zoviet-amerikka"" closes the CD with a hip-hop and funk rampage that
fades into a classical ode to the decay of the U.S.A. <P>

""nada is the product of years of frustrated attempts to create a
distinctive band in the San Jose Area,"" said Robert M. Riddle IV. After
playing with <B>Autumn Cathedral</B>, Riddle formed <B>Swivelfaust</B>
and <B>Slur</B> before the decision to start nada as a solo project.
Riddle enlisted the talents of other musicians, including Scott Martinez
(Autumn Cathedral), Damien Gonzalez (Swivelfaust, Slur) and Mason Jones
(Trance).  The album was recorded at House of Faith in Palo Alto by Bart
Thurber and produced by nada and Mason Jones. ""This is the most
satisfying mix of electronic, experimental, psychedelic and rock music
that I have been able to create so far."" <P>

Nada uses influences as diverse as tribal drumming, techno sampling,
hip-hop rhythms, wailing guitar and experimental noise to come up with a
rich audio tapestry that is reminiscent of music by <B>Coil</B>, <B>The
Legendary Pink Dots</B> and <B>Savage Republic</B> that should appeal
most listening tastes. <P>

You only have to ask singer/songwriter <b>Eileen Joyner</b> 
one question to see that she's different. If you ask most

<b>Eileen</n> got her start performing in comedy clubs in

You let me down so gently<BR>

<i>A letter from June:</i><p>

I have been writing music since 1984 -- the year the ""end of the world"" 
was predicted and found it to be rather a good beginning.  I give God all 
the glory for my inspiration and I am sure there are many that claim 
inspiration, but the Book of James says that every good and perfect gift 
comes from the Father, and what perfection there is in my music is a gift 
from the God of the United States.  It usually takes me between 10 and 20 
minutes to write a song, usually less, and I rarely have corrections to 
make, only minor ones, a conjunction or the like.  I am 55 this July, 
should the Lord let me continue to live, and am co-owner in a dental 
laboratory with my husband.  I have run for office three times, holding 
up the principes of free enterprise which made this nation great and 
which will explain my concern for a real market, I am founder of a 
publishing company and missionary society, again in conjunction with my 
wonderful husband and am an ordained minister of the gospel.  I have a 
daughter and a son, two step-daughters and beloved grandchildren.  I have 
dedicated my life to rebuilding America with a special dedication and 
burden of bringing glory to my forefathers of God's music.  I have 
written over 200 songs and poems, but find that the stronghold of 
merchandising control makes it nearly impossible to promote any music 
beyond what is according to someone's preplanned agenda.  The old saying 
says, ""Let me write the music of the nation, and I care not who writes 
the laws.""  I will continue to write and trust God to punish thieves and 
make them pay back fourfold, in this life, as well as in eternity.<p>

				<b>Sincerely - for Christ,</b><p>

<B>Coat</B>'s roller coaster ""Squirrel"" is a turbulent mix of noisy grinding guitars,
hushed feverish vocals, rockin' nimble bass and smashing drums, all packed into 
one of the most intriguing three and a half minute pop singles in recent memory.

This band combines two dense guitars layers with dramatically shifting song 
dynamics without sounding messy and contrived. Fused with playful structural
psychadelics, this combination results in an explosive burst of pop that's been turned 
upside down, melded with darkness, and produces an intoxicating brew of melodic 
whimsy. Coat pushes the limits of noise!
<P>
With their boy-girl-boy-girl line up, Coat can come off as gratifyingly raw or 
gleamingly pop. Yet this L.A. based quartet has a limitless capacity for drawing one in with 
achy guitar melodies. Their hyper-hypnotic rhythms combined with oddly accessible pop 
hooks, create a natural flowing buoyancy. If you like your pop hard and heavy combined 
with an avalanche of punched up riffs, then check out Coat!

<b>What the Cat Dragged In</b> is an <b>unsigned</b> and flat broke band
of Yale graduate students.  Originally formed in late 1992, the band has played 
numerous clubs in the New Haven area as well as the annual Summertime
Street Festival. The band's instrumentation includes (but is not limited
to) guitar, keyboards, bass and drums.<p>

On Nov. 5, 1994, the band released its first full-length CD,
<b>Scratch Tracks</b>.  This entirely independent release was 
co-produced with Jim Chapdelaine (Mr. Right).  The CD contains
12 tracks for a total running time of 54:02 and includes an 8 panel
full-color insert with lyrics, pictures, and graphics.  
<b>Big Love</b> is the first track off the CD to receive air time.<p>

All of us take turns at lead vocal which adds alot of variety to our
music.  Additionally, we each come to the band from different musical 
backgrounds, so our music moves through the entire spectrum of genres.
The above song was chosen for distribution through IUMA because we feel it
represents an intriguing combination of our musical interests.<p>

<h1><b>AL REINGOLD</b></h1> <p>

<h4><i>""Spain""</i> from the CD <i><b>""Stranger Looking In""</b></i></h4><p>

<CENTER> <i>
""Landed in Spain just an hour ago <BR>
 Already I'm walking the streets <BR>
 I need a friend to heal my desperate soul <BR>
 Cold strangers are all that I meet...""
</i> </CENTER><p>

 	<b>Al Reingold</b> began to formally play piano at age 3.  
After a decade of recitals, competitions, and practice in both 
Suzuki and traditional methods, his interests led him to add 
contemporary rock-and-roll to his strict classical 
background.  Since moving to Atlanta in 1989, <b> Al Reingold</b> 
has been has been playing music professionally, from 
accompanying well-known local artists on stage to scoring an 
all-original soundtrack for a local production of <i>""Driving Miss 
Daisy.""</i>  From this seamless blend of the traditional and 
digital worlds, <b>Reingold</b> creates a hauntingly familiar 
sound, that gently stretches the boundaries from the classical 
realm to the New Age.<p>

  	<b>Al Reingold</b> uses these unique melodic lines to frame 
his debut, <i><b>""Stranger Looking In""</i></b>, which 
<b>Reingold</b> released on his own label, <b>SLI Records, 
Ltd</b>.  This vast undertaking was completely arranged and 
produced by the artist himself, and ranges from rock-n-roll, to 
jazz, to blues, to classical and to the New Age.  He recorded 
each piece with different guest musicians, including some of 
Atlanta's finest players.  In addition to crafting the music 
and lyrics, <b>Al Reingold</b> plays piano, synthesizers, 
acoustic guitar, mandolin and percussion.<p>

Here's a listing of the players on the featured song, 
<b><i>""SPAIN""</i></b>:<br>
<dl>
<dd><b>Eliss Hadley</b>, vocals
<dd><b>Al Reingold</b>, piano, rainstick
<dd><b>David Patterson</b>, classical guitar
<dd><b>Chris McMahon</b>, acoustic bass
<dd><b>Matthew Kahler</b>, congas</dl><p>

  	 Since releasing <i><b>""Stranger Looking In,""</i> 
Reingold</b> has returned to the stage in Chicago and Atlanta, 
now performing his own compositions as a solo artist.  
Furthermore, <b>Reingold</b> continually records his own new 
material and has two distinct albums in  the pre-production 
stages.<p>

# __AL REINGOLD__

 

#### _""Spain""_ from the CD ___""Stranger Looking In""___

<center> <i>
""Landed in Spain just an hour ago <br/>
 Already I'm walking the streets <br/>
 I need a friend to heal my desperate soul <br/>
 Cold strangers are all that I meet...""
</i> </center>

__Al Reingold__ began to formally play piano at age 3. After a decade of recitals, competitions, and practice in both Suzuki and traditional methods, his interests led him to add contemporary rock-and-roll to his strict classical background. Since moving to Atlanta in 1989, __ Al Reingold__ has been has been playing music professionally, from accompanying well-known local artists on stage to scoring an all-original soundtrack for a local production of _""Driving Miss Daisy.""_ From this seamless blend of the traditional and digital worlds, __Reingold__ creates a hauntingly familiar sound, that gently stretches the boundaries from the classical realm to the New Age.

__Al Reingold__ uses these unique melodic lines to frame his debut, ___""Stranger Looking In""___, which __Reingold__ released on his own label, __SLI Records, Ltd__. This vast undertaking was completely arranged and produced by the artist himself, and ranges from rock-n-roll, to jazz, to blues, to classical and to the New Age. He recorded each piece with different guest musicians, including some of Atlanta's finest players. In addition to crafting the music and lyrics, __Al Reingold__ plays piano, synthesizers, acoustic guitar, mandolin and percussion.

Here's a listing of the players on the featured song, ___""SPAIN""___:  

<dl>
<dd><b>Eliss Hadley</b>, vocals
<dd><b>Al Reingold</b>, piano, rainstick
<dd><b>David Patterson</b>, classical guitar
<dd><b>Chris McMahon</b>, acoustic bass
<dd><b>Matthew Kahler</b>, congas</dd></dd></dd></dd></dd></dl>

 	 Since releasing ___""Stranger Looking In,""___ Reingold has returned to the stage in Chicago and Atlanta, now performing his own compositions as a solo artist. Furthermore, __Reingold__ continually records his own new material and has two distinct albums in the pre-production stages.

<h1>Connie Champagne</h1>
<h2>La Strada</h2>
The first thing you notice about <b><i>La Strada</i></b> is 
Connie Champagne's voice. Opening with the Velvet Underground 
classic ""All Tomorrow's Parties"", Connie grabs hold of the song 
and never lets go. The band charges the opening chords with 
intensity and skill, creating a 3-D wall of sound built from 
electric guitars, clarinet and exotic percussion. Listening to 
the next few tunes, you begin to realize that 
<b><i>La Strada</i></b> is no ordinary singer/songwriter debut 
album.<p>

<b><i>La Strada</i></b> is truly an eclectic album. Each song 
is a story, stylistically ranging from rock to jazz, retro-pop 
to smoky torch song. Rarely before has there been a recording 
that successfully covers so many different styles of music. 
With <b><i>La Strada</i></b> Connie brings a new dimension to 
alternative music.<p>

""Judy Garland meets Iggy Pop"" -- <i>Billboard</i><p>

Excerpted from an interview with Ms. Karen Eliot, editor of <i>BULLET TRAIN</i>:<p>

<i>When and where did the band coalesce?</i><p>

		<b>Hungry Ghost</b> began in 1937 near Brussels, but the band really began creating in earnest about a year ago.  Our home base is San Francisco, but Ulbrecht recently moved to Moscow for a two-year stint posing as an American attorney.  Bhopal coordinates his efforts from San Diego, California because he likes to surf with the sharks.<p>

<i>How would you describe the music?</i><p>

		We consider our stuff pretty diverse.  We strive to create ambient soundscapes and sound collages with an ethnic-industrial twist.<p>

<i>How does the band create the music?</i><p>

		We do a lot of free forming.  Most times we start with sound clips taken from the urban environment that surrounds us and then mush 'em together with guitars, percussion, samplers and synthesizers.  A lot of times we do long, improvisational jam sessions and take out short clips for further manipulation.<p>

		Other times, we have a particular mood or idea in mind and create songs around this concept with whatever sound is handy at the time.<p>

		We work well together; everyone has a finger in the creation of a song.<p>

<i>Where do you do your creating?</i><p>

		We have our own studio, called DS2 (Death of a Supermodel or 2) here in San Francisco.  It's clean and warm and has everything we require.  The digital age has made us self-sufficient in our creative efforts.<p>

<i>Do you have any recordings available yet?</i><p>

		We  have two jukebox 45s floating around.  One is a single with two cuts:  <i>""Maimana Casque""</i> and <i>""Quechua Click.""</i>  Recently, we cut a joint single with friends from Portland, Oregon.  Our cut is called <i>""Miles.""</i>  On the flip side is a band called <b>Compost</b>.<p>

		Around August 1994, we'll be releasing our first CD, which is entitled <i><b>""Brownout at the Spectacle.""</i></b><p>

                These items are available through our label, Galivant Media in San Francisco.  You can mail order all of it.<p>

<i>Any other projects in the works?</i><p>

	Yeah . . .  We have some videos in the works.  We've been shooting a lot of Super 8mm film, which is a truly wonderful medium.  Very grainy and great texture; quite a contrast to the sterility of most other formats.  When a song gives us particular inspiration, we create some visual images to accompany it.  We're planning on distributing the videos through Galivant Media, and we have plans to air the videos on <b>OFFLINE</b>, which is a public access program distributed on networks around the United States.<p>

	We're working on a soundtrack for a public access film about graffiti art in subway tunnels.  It's in the works...<p>

	We're also working with multimedia artists who produce CD-ROMs.  The group is called Cafe-E, and they're in New York.  We provide them with ""content,"" as it's called in the venacular.<p>

<i>Do you have any plans to tour?</i><p>

		Not as yet, but we're not averse to live gigs.  We want to wait until there is sufficient interest in our music before we venture forth from the comfortable confines of DS2.  When we do decide to tour, we'd like to start in Europe.  That way we can tour and vacation at the same time.  We feel no pressure though.<p>

<i>Is there any political bent in the music?</i><p>

		Just the usual smash the State stuff.  We don't use lyrics as such, so the sound textures are more open to interpretation than the straight narrative stuff in most music.  This drives some people crazy, but we expect each listener to interpret the soundscapes in their own way based on what they're thinking or feeling at the time.   We definitely have our own political agendas, but they aren't essential to our musical agendas.<p>

<B>J. L. Porter</B>'s California is
Central Valley tule fog on I-5, grunion runs on Windansea beach in La
Jolla, rows of Bart Simpson banks on Tijuana's main drag. It's a world
of weekend road trips, beach parties, and college football games. And,
it's where love and innocence are found, and lost, and found again,
someplace between a margarita and a forgotten Elvis movie.

<P> 
Viva La Revolucion! has
been lauded not only by San Diego's music press, but also in the pages
of Nashville-based national magazine <I>Performing Songrwriter</I>. Porter is
a regular performer at San Diego's coffeehouses and bars.

<center><h1>J. L. Porter</h1></center>

__J. L. Porter__'s California is
Central Valley tule fog on I-5, grunion runs on Windansea beach in La
Jolla, rows of Bart Simpson banks on Tijuana's main drag. It's a world
of weekend road trips, beach parties, and college football games. And,
it's where love and innocence are found, and lost, and found again,
someplace between a margarita and a forgotten Elvis movie. 

<a href=""/IUMA/ftp/music/JL_Porter/cover-JL_Porter.jpg""><img align=""left"" alt=""[JL Porter: album cover]"" height=""112"" hspace=""5"" src=""/IUMA/ftp/music/JL_Porter/cover-JL_Porter.gif"" vspace=""3"" width=""120""/></a>Porter's debut CD, __Viva La Revolucion!__ (on independent label PermanentRecords Del Mar), covers all these bases and more. The 12 songs,performed by Porter (on his trusty Vox Wildcat guitar) and drummer__Brendan Kremer__, feature stripped-down arrangements and a light,rockabilly feel. This disc is produced by Porter and fellow San Diegosinger/songwriter ""Famous"" Steve Denyes. 

 Viva La Revolucion! hasbeen lauded not only by San Diego's music press, but also in the pagesof Nashville-based national magazine _Performing Songrwriter_. Porter isa regular performer at San Diego's coffeehouses and bars.

<H1>Eve B.</H1>
</CENTER>
Singer, songwriter, arranger and performer, <B>Eve B.</B>, has been performing
in the Boston area since 1990 when she formed and fronted the band,
Eve'n Up. The band played Eve's original tunes in Boston clubs for
three years headlining and opening for other area locals before Eve
decided to go solo in 1993.
<P>
Eve's musical past also includes the recording of a single on an
independent European label in 1988, tours of Japan and France in 1988
and 1989, and more recently, performances with The Berklee College of
Music Gospel Choir as a soloist in 1993.
<P>
Among Eve's various musical projects are several self-produced demos.
The most recent, a four-song CD entitled, Innocence, is the culmination
of her performing and songwriting experience. The four songs on the CD
were written, produced and arranged by Eve B. with assistance from
songwriter/ guitarist, Andrea Bensmiller, who previously performed in
the Boston acoustic scene. Eve and Andrea merged their talents in 1994
to form EB Productions and have since continued to write, arrange and
produce together.

<A HREF=""Innocence-cover.jpg"">
<IMG ALT=""[Innocence: album cover]"" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=143
VSPACE=4 HSPACE=7 ALIGN=left
SRC=""Innocence-cover.gif""></A>
The four tracks included on Innocence are ""Sexy Thing"", ""Innocence"",
""Invitation"", and ""Field of Hope"". Each tune showcases Eve's soulful,
sultry, and purely original vocal style. Eve's creative and tasteful
integration of vocal riffs and runs makes each tune breathe with soul
and originality. The songs can best be described as a blend of pop and
R&B with a strong gospel influence. Arrangements are characterized by
the complex interweaving of keyboards and guitars, and lush harmonic
backing vocals.

Andrea Bensmiller of EB Productions at (617) 437-6944.

<H1>LEAD PIPE CINCH</H1>

	The human ear searches for sounds that are unique and melodic.  
The human eye looks for color and excitement, and the human body responds 
to tension and energy.  <B>Lead Pipe Cinch</B> demands these reactions!  
Not even a year-old, this Seattle band quickly developed a sound and 
energy all it's own. <I> ""Big Rock!""</I> says Abe Beason from <B>90.3 
KCMU</B> in Seattle.<P>

	After a successful first demo which garnered college radio play 
throughout the Northwest, Lead Cinch Pipe has recorded 3 new songs that 
show the maturity and growth of the band.  <I>Winnipeg</I>, <I>Gun</I>, 
and <I>I Suspend</I>, are new pieces which feature the diversity and 
excitement of their music.  Lead Pipe Cinch has played with national 
acts, headlined it's own shows in Vancouver, B.C., Seattle, Ellensburg, 
Spokane, and performed live on Seattle college radio station 
<B>KCMU</B>.  Soon to be exposed internationally through the 
<I>Internet</I>, Lead Pipe Cinch is creating a buzz throughout the 
underground.  Hooky, melodic and heavy are operative adjectives for LPC's 
songs, which complement their assaulting, in your face live performance.  
Excited and confident from overwhelmingly positive audience response, 
Lead Pipe Cinch gathers steam in their ardent quest to <I>Rock The

<h2>SomeTimes Goodbye</h2>
by Pattrex
<h4>Approximate length: 3:30 Stereo Recording</h4>
Songs available (there's more songs at 
<a href=""http://www.com/99x/pattrex.html"">http://www.com/99x/pattrex.html</a>):
<p>

Pattrex is a new media artist. All instruments
and vocals performed, produced, and composed by Pattrex. Copyright 1995
Pattrex.  Email at ""pattrex@npixi.com"". <p>

Pattrex performs with a 4 piece backing band occasionally. They are loud
(like a jet taking off at a distance of 10 feet), so bring ear protection
when you see them. Yes, Pattrex is a vegetarian but that doesn't mean he
is a ""nice mellow kind of guy"". Hemorrhaging at concerts is not a fun
thing. Protect your ears. Always. <p>

The idea behind Pattrex is to create exciting experiences utilizing
available technology. Pattrex is
part of an emerging convergence of these tools. The song you'll be
listening to is a midtempo type pop thing.  Kinda sounds like a cross
between Smashing Pumpkins and Peter Gabriel. And then some.  The music is
real. If
you like what you hear and want to hear more please send check or money
order of $9.00 plus $2.00 shipping and handling to: <p>
<dl>
<dd><b><a href=""http://www.yak.net/pub/emptystreet/emptystreet.html"">Empty
Street Productions</a></b>
<dd>931 Monroe Drive STE 102-183
<dd>Atlanta, GA 30308
</dl> <p>

For a 4 song cassette tape and some propaganda mailings. If you ask, we'll
even enclose a Macintosh Floppy Disk Demo (requires a color capable Mac
and at least a 13"" screen).  Allow 6 weeks for delivery (A&R reps get free
tape if they promise to listen to the damn thing, send email). <p>

There are several Pattrex Web Sites available throughout the universe.
Here's a popular one: <A HREF=""
http://www.com/99x/pattrex.html"">http://www.com/99x/pattrex.html</A><p>



You will soon be able to electronically order a Pattrex CD EP over various
BBS's. This will really expedite things, 'cause you'll be able to use your
credit card and get the CD mailed to you overnight. Wow. Again, send email
if you are interested in that. This should be up and running by May 1995 <p>


Most of what you are hearing was created and recorded digitally. The
studio this was recorded in is a tiny back room at Empty Street in
Atlanta, GA. Most of the studio lives in a Macintosh IIvx computer with a
1.2 GB Hard Disk and Opcode's StudioVision sequencer/digital recorder.
Pattrex used inexpensive and readily-available hardware and software for
this effort. Mackie mixers were used, and Alesis effects devices. I
recommend these brands pretty highly. Tannoy speakers (PBM 6.5s). Also, a
basic Tascam 488 cassette 8 track was used to slave in some additional
tracks. Pretty simple stuff, actually.  The only semi-expensive element
was an AKG C414 microphone I rented for a day for $10 from Private Studios
in Champaign Illinois (thanks Jon! PS: call up and harass Jon at (217)
367-3530). Oh, yeah- a cool 12 string electric guitar was borrowed from CV
LLoyde's in Champaign (call (217) 352-7031 to harass Gary and CV and order
stuff). <p>

But that's not all...<p>

Pattrex has several multimedia demos available on-line through the
internet and on services such as America Online and Compuserve. One of
these, the first Macintosh-created music industry promo clip available on
the Internet, is called ""pats music video"" and is available via anonymous
ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu under directory /info-mac/grf/qt. Pattrex
also has appeared on the Internet ""musenet"" 1992 compilation CD with the
song ""There's Love Here Today"", and on the 10th AMUG CDROM compilation
BBS-In-A-Box (available through the Arizona Macintosh Users Group).
Pattrex is a founding member of the renegade multimedia group ""NPiX
InterActive"", and creates freelance multimedia for the entertainment
industry in his spare time. <p>


Pattrex is a member of IICS (International Interactive Computing Society),
ASCAP, and an Apple Associate Developer and MultiMedia Program member.
Pattrex is also part of <A HREF=""http://www.npixi.com/NPiX2.html"">NPiX
Interactive</A>.<p>


You *might* be able to reach Pattrex at (404) US-FOLKS. Maybe. That
machine is pretty flaky, though. Email is best. Or voice mail us at (404)
892-1971.<p>


Critics say:<p>

""Hot, Hot, Hot. It sure is f*cking hot out today, why the hell don't you
get air conditioning huh?""<br>

<b>     - Gary Strater of the band StarCastle</b> formerly on Epic Records
(check out StarCastle's upcoming album!)</b><p>

""I hope you know your rent is past due. Again.""<br>

<b>     - Donald Mead, Landlord</b> (PS: send don email at dmm@prism.gatech.edu

""Hey babe, get used to it""<br>

<b>     - Meghan Neely</b>, drunk groupie from Mocksville, North Carolina (Stay

""Thank you for your submission. Even though we called you and asked for a
copy of your EP, we have no intention of listening to it. Actually, unless
you are my boss's kid sister or are willing to sleep with my German
Shepherd I don't think I will even return your calls.  Pretty funny, huh?
How's THAT grab you buddy?""<br>

<b>     - Anonymous (ex)Major Label executive</b> from a company on Sunset in

""It is loud and bothered me. It made my liver hurt. And I had to go to the

Pattrex is a new media artist. All instrumentsand vocals performed, produced, and composed by Pattrex. Copyright 1995Pattrex. Email at ""pattrex@npixi.com"". 

Pattrex performs with a 4 piece backing band occasionally. They are loud(like a jet taking off at a distance of 10 feet), so bring ear protectionwhen you see them. Yes, Pattrex is a vegetarian but that doesn't mean heis a ""nice mellow kind of guy"". Hemorrhaging at concerts is not a funthing. Protect your ears. Always. 

The idea behind Pattrex is to create exciting experiences utilizingavailable technology. Pattrex ispart of an emerging convergence of these tools. The song you'll belistening to is a midtempo type pop thing. Kinda sounds like a crossbetween Smashing Pumpkins and Peter Gabriel. And then some. The music isreal. Ifyou like what you hear and want to hear more please send check or moneyorder of $9.00 plus $2.00 shipping and handling to:

For a 4 song cassette tape and some propaganda mailings. If you ask, we'lleven enclose a Macintosh Floppy Disk Demo (requires a color capable Macand at least a 13"" screen). Allow 6 weeks for delivery (A&amp;R reps get freetape if they promise to listen to the damn thing, send email). 

There are several Pattrex Web Sites available throughout the universe.Here's a popular one: [http://www.com/99x/pattrex.html](
http://www.com/99x/pattrex.html)

You will soon be able to electronically order a Pattrex CD EP over variousBBS's. This will really expedite things, 'cause you'll be able to use yourcredit card and get the CD mailed to you overnight. Wow. Again, send emailif you are interested in that. This should be up and running by May 1995 

Most of what you are hearing was created and recorded digitally. Thestudio this was recorded in is a tiny back room at Empty Street inAtlanta, GA. Most of the studio lives in a Macintosh IIvx computer with a1.2 GB Hard Disk and Opcode's StudioVision sequencer/digital recorder.Pattrex used inexpensive and readily-available hardware and software forthis effort. Mackie mixers were used, and Alesis effects devices. Irecommend these brands pretty highly. Tannoy speakers (PBM 6.5s). Also, abasic Tascam 488 cassette 8 track was used to slave in some additionaltracks. Pretty simple stuff, actually. The only semi-expensive elementwas an AKG C414 microphone I rented for a day for $10 from Private Studiosin Champaign Illinois (thanks Jon! PS: call up and harass Jon at (217)367-3530). Oh, yeah- a cool 12 string electric guitar was borrowed from CVLLoyde's in Champaign (call (217) 352-7031 to harass Gary and CV and orderstuff). 

But that's not all...

Pattrex has several multimedia demos available on-line through theinternet and on services such as America Online and Compuserve. One ofthese, the first Macintosh-created music industry promo clip available onthe Internet, is called ""pats music video"" and is available via anonymousftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu under directory /info-mac/grf/qt. Pattrexalso has appeared on the Internet ""musenet"" 1992 compilation CD with thesong ""There's Love Here Today"", and on the 10th AMUG CDROM compilationBBS-In-A-Box (available through the Arizona Macintosh Users Group).Pattrex is a founding member of the renegade multimedia group ""NPiXInterActive"", and creates freelance multimedia for the entertainmentindustry in his spare time. 

Pattrex is a member of IICS (International Interactive Computing Society),ASCAP, and an Apple Associate Developer and MultiMedia Program member.Pattrex is also part of [NPiXInteractive](http://www.npixi.com/NPiX2.html).

You \*might\* be able to reach Pattrex at (404) US-FOLKS. Maybe. Thatmachine is pretty flaky, though. Email is best. Or voice mail us at (404)892-1971.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3>Biography</CENTER></FONT><P>

Adam Bomb has lived behind ""enemy lines"" for most of his life, much to
his dismay. As a white male, he watched his fellow Anglo-Americans
create and perpetuate racist, prejudiced and sexist ideals. With his
self-produced debut of ""Organic Hard-Core"" Rap he is out to unsettle
the status quo and give them a dose, from one of ""their own"", of
something that they have been deaf to for far too long... the TRUTH.

</TABLE></CENTER><P>





Adam Bomb's rhymes defend individual freedom, attack authority and
define true liberty which, to him, is more than just privileges for the
advantaged few. His music throbs and grooves with funky samples, rock
and funk inspired guitar tracks, keyboards, and live horns.  <P>
""Government, religion, and social standing are not excuses for racism,
sexism, oppression and censorship by the powers that be,"" Adam Bomb
says. ""The Constitution was a great document, in theory, but its ideals
have not been afforded, to this day, to all men and womyn equally. It
has never been anything more than a fairy tale to many of the people
who in large part built this country, but have to ask permission to
share the dream."" <P> His tracks confront everything from racist
attitudes of the powers that be, to sexism and the failing two-party
political system. ""Stand On Up"", inspired by a Malcolm X speech warn
all races that things haven't changed enough to relax on any level, and
that action like that of the 60's Civil Rights movement is still a
must:  <P><I> 'Cause if you're sittin' then you're just a sittin'
duck<BR> Lettin' those who choose, bombs instead of schools<BR> Still
vote for the sucker, if ya vote at all fool<P></I>

In ""Peacemaker, Soulshaker"", Adam Bomb serves up other ideologies he
disdains -- misogyny, organized religion, bigotry and violence among
all races of people who should be fighting the system rather than
smoking dope, drinking ""40's"" and killing each other.  <P> ""The System""
calls for an end to the two-party system which as Adam Bomb sees it is
a farce. ""Although the two groups make a lot of noise espousing
different points of view, they are essentially the same. They have
their own best interests in mind and the true needs of the masses are
not even an issue"".  <P><I> My vision<BR> Destroy the institution<BR>

who are obsessed with firearms.  <P><I> Mother don't cry, he only

By attacking long since established views, values and philosophies,
Adam Bomb is prepared for criticism from middle America. He is also
prepared for the Hip-Hop and Rap communities to come at him as well by
virtue of the fact that his skin is white. ""I've seen it happen, and
quite frankly in many cases, people got what they deserved. I feel my
music is different. My lyrics are relevant and I am not wasting
people's time to fill my pockets. It's people's minds I hope to help
set free"".<P>

Realizing his passion for expressing himself through music at an early
age, Adam Bomb formed a band with his brother when he was barely out of
elementary school. He went from high school to study sound design at
the Berklee College of Music in Boston. It was during his college years
that Adam Bomb discovered a powerful from of expression that spoke to
him and the ideals that he believed in vehemently. He walked in to a
record store one day and knew that in Rap he had found his niche. ""I
heard Public Enemy in a local store, and their message and delivery
inspired me to change my outlook on music"", Adam Bomb recalls. ""Chuck
D's lyrics were intelligent, deep and pertinent."" Chuck D, KRS-1 and
Ice Cube became his strongest Rap influences.<P>

Adam Bomb's first project was producing a young rapper named Stud B. As
Adam Bomb learned about rap as an art form, he began producing tracks
for both himself and Stud B, that were both political and original.
Songs like ""Earth to the White Man"" and ""Proof is in the Pudding"",
which was a reaction to the Rodney King beating, were results of the
pairs collaboration.<P>

Now a resident of Los Angeles, Adam Bomb continues to grow and evolve as
an artist. He keeps his ears, heart and mind open for innovative sounds
and ideas and persists at expressing the truth, which he hopes will force
those ""in charge"" to finally own up to their wrongs and relinquish the
power to those who should have had it all along.  <P> <HR><P>

Exploding across the Net, North America, and Europe!<P> I got your tape in
the post this morning. i listened to all of it before coming in to work.
it really is great, 'organic hardcore' just about describes it for me.<P>
a couple of the tracks have got double vocals on them - are they both you?
- one at a higher pitch than the other, this sounds a lot like early PE,
I'm thinking of 'megablast' especially.<P> I also picked up house of pain

AsAdam Bomb learned about rap as an art form, he began producing tracksfor both himself and Stud B, that were both political and original.Songs like ""Earth to the White Man"" and ""Proof is in the Pudding"",which was a reaction to the Rodney King beating, were results of thepairs collaboration.

Now a resident of Los Angeles, Adam Bomb continues to grow and evolve asan artist. He keeps his ears, heart and mind open for innovative soundsand ideas and persists at expressing the truth, which he hopes will forcethose ""in charge"" to finally own up to their wrongs and relinquish thepower to those who should have had it all along.

Exploding across the Net, North America, and Europe!

 I got your tape inthe post this morning. i listened to all of it before coming in to work.it really is great, 'organic hardcore' just about describes it for me.

a couple of the tracks have got double vocals on them - are they both you?- one at a higher pitch than the other, this sounds a lot like early PE,I'm thinking of 'megablast' especially.

 I also picked up house of pain&amp; ratm (your voice - in places) styles, yet not derivative, moreexpansive.

 I'll be playing your tape on my show tonight.

Deth Specula was spawned in Santa Cruz, California. We are a neo-retro 
band, playing both original music and covers. The song loaded onto 
the Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA) is ""Get Even More,"" 
our personal advice for when things go bad: Don't get mad, don't 
get even, get even more!<p>

Deth Specula was formed by the crafty Malcom McCameron a couple of 
years ago, and was an immediate hit with some of the band's friends. 
Deth Specula is:<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Kozmo</b> - rhythm guitar, vocals
<li><b>Malcom McCameron</b> - lead guitar, management
<li><b>Tim E Rotarian (aka Timmy, aka Timmer)</b> - lead vocals
<li><b>RaSTrO!</b> - drums
<li><b>Yam</b> - bass, vocals
</ul>
Immediately after forming the band, Malcom booked the group on a series 
of World Tours. It seemed like a good idea at the time.  However, 
by sheer coincidence, every single gig they tried to play, such as 
Kuwait City in January of 1991, or Clarke Air Force Base in the Philippines, 
was canceled due to some kind of natural or human-caused disaster. 
Recently, Malcom vainly tried to put together a Yugoslavia Cease-Fire 
Tour following the latest United Nations declarations, but again war
intervened and the tour was cancelled.<p>

Because of the Yugoslavia Cease-Fire Tour debacle, Deth Specula has 
many concert t-shirts left over, most of which are stored in Malcom's

<h2>ABOUT THE DEMO SONG <i>Get Even More</i>:</h2>

<i>Get Even More</i> is for anyone who gets screwed over by Fate,
The System, a lover, your boss, or whatever. We have always
considered it a special song because members of Deth Specula,
many of our fans, and close friends lost their jobs over the 
last couple of years.<p>

The song was recorded at the drummer's house on a Tascam 8-track 
cassette. Vocals (Timmy, Yam and Kozmo) were recorded on the back 
porch and the guitars (Malcom and Kozmo) were recorded in the bathroom. 
Drums (RaStRo!) were recorded in the bedroom and the bass
(Yam) was direct. Although it was mastered on cassette (oh joy), the 
end result is not too shabby. However, we can't wait to rerecord this 
in a studio.<p>

Engineering was handled by Eric ""Sharky"" Davis, the Mystery Sixth
Member of the band. Sharky takes care of our live sound, much
of our recording, camera work, and general technical stuff.
We couldn't have done it without him.<p>

<i>Get Even More</i> is one of our most popular live songs (along with
our cover of ""Radar Love"" and our original ""(I'm in Love with a) 
Gutterslut."" We play it just as well live as on tape, in case you
were wondering. :-)<p>

<i>I Wanna Be Updated</i> is Deth Specula's bonus song for the IUMA. It's a
spoof on the Ramones song <i>I Wanna Be Sedated</i> to reflect what it's like
to working for a software company. Here'some lyrics for example:
<pre>
   Twenty, twenty, twenty-four hours to go,
     I wanna be updated.
   Nothing to do, nowhere to go,
     I wanna be updated.

   Get me to the trade show,  
   put me on a plane.
   Send it to me Fed Ex,
   before I go insane.
   I can't control my budget,
   can't drink away the pain,
   Oh no no no no!
 </pre><p>
 These guys are a tight rock band and this song rules. Check it out.<p>

Deth Specula was spawned in Santa Cruz, California. We are a neo-retro band, playing both original music and covers. The song loaded onto the Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA) is ""Get Even More,"" our personal advice for when things go bad: Don't get mad, don't get even, get even more!

Deth Specula was formed by the crafty Malcom McCameron a couple of years ago, and was an immediate hit with some of the band's friends. Deth Specula is:

*   __Kozmo__ - rhythm guitar, vocals<li><b>Malcom McCameron</b> - lead guitar, management<li><b>Tim E Rotarian (aka Timmy, aka Timmer)</b> - lead vocals
<li><b>RaSTrO!</b> - drums
<li><b>Yam</b> - bass, vocals
</li></li></li></li>

Immediately after forming the band, Malcom booked the group on a series of World Tours. It seemed like a good idea at the time. However, by sheer coincidence, every single gig they tried to play, such as Kuwait City in January of 1991, or Clarke Air Force Base in the Philippines, was canceled due to some kind of natural or human-caused disaster. Recently, Malcom vainly tried to put together a Yugoslavia Cease-Fire Tour following the latest United Nations declarations, but again warintervened and the tour was cancelled.

Because of the Yugoslavia Cease-Fire Tour debacle, Deth Specula has many concert t-shirts left over, most of which are stored in Malcom's dad's garage. For information on buying a t-shirt or other Specula paraphernalia (buttons, bumper stickers), send e-mail to:

__specula@deth.com__

Ask to be subscribed to our monthly, on-line fanzine. New subscribers get a free bumper sticker and a couple of buttons, and we'll send you prices and other information.

## Introduction

</a>

Veterinary Informatics and Epidemiology (VIE) is a research group organised jointly by the [University of Strathclyde](http://www.strath.ac.uk/) and the [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/). The working association of researchers in animal disease and modelling at the two establishments extends over two decades and this partnership was formally recognised in 1992.

The personnel comprising VIE are located in several Departments, with the administrative centres being the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Glasgow and the [Department of Statistics and Modelling Science](http://www.stams.strath.ac.uk/) at the University of Strathclyde. The group is under the co-direction of Professor George Gettinby (Strathclyde) and Dr. Stuart Reid (Glasgow).

The Kuntz lab consists of two groups: a ""dockers"" group, which is

is known.  Our best known tool is the program <a

""Our son was misdiagnosed for more than two years.  You cannot imagine the nightmare we lived through.  The professionals we saw could not identify his illness.  We spent huge sums of money searching for an answer.  When his disorder was finally diagnosed, we learned that it was so rare, physicians knew little about it.  There seems to be no treatment, and very little research giving us hope for his future.""<p>
Although this parent thought her story was unique, millions of Americans with rare disorders have suffered similar agonies.  Names of their illnesses may be different, but most have experienced the indignity of searching for help in vain.  Rare disorders are ""back of the textbook"" illnesses, unfamiliar to the general public and professionals alike.  They can strike people of all ages, all races, and all ethnic backgrounds.  Many are genetic; others are acquired through environmental causes. But for most, the cause is still unknown.  Thus, even after a family obtains a proper diagnosis, they are too often left with more unanswerable questions.<p>

is interleafed with true complex systems simulations of biological, chemical and

<dd>Welcome to the BITMed Simulation Server at the University of
California, San Diego.  This server is unique in that the WWW hypertext
is interleafed with true complex systems simulations of biological, chemical and
physical systems.  We are presently building several virtual environments

The Center for Advanced Medical Informatics at Stanford was established in 1990 to create links between academic, research, and administrative computing activities in the <A HREF=""http://med-www.stanford.edu/MedCenter/MedSchool/medschool.html"">Stanford University School of Medicine</A>, and to serve as a source of advice to the Deans office on <A HREF=""whatisinformatics.html"">informatics</A> issues. The Center was then funded in 1992 by the <A HREF=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/"">National Library of Medicine (NLM)</A> to create a shared computing resource to support research activities in biomedical informatics. This resource is also named CAMIS and supports an active core research program, the computing infrastructure and day-to-day computing needs of a large number of researchers, each of whom has external support from <A HREF=""http://www.nih.gov/"">NIH (the National Institutes of Health)</A> or other agencies through grants or contracts. Though the CAMIS resource is <A HREF=""http://www.stanford.edu"">Stanford</A>-based, its mission has a national character, which includes support of national electronic mail distribution lists, extensive on-line information resources, an annual CAMIS symposium, three academic training programs, a visiting scholar program and a national advisory council. The nominal location of CAMIS is in the <A HREF=""http://www-camis.stanford.edu/maps/map_msob.html"">Medical School Office Building (MSOB)</A> on the <A HREF=""http://www-pcd.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/map/map.html?msob"">Stanford University campus</A>.

<font size=+2>T</font><font size=+1>hese </font>
<font size=+2>P</font><font size=+1>ages</font>. 
These pages serve a number of functions. First, you will find information about the Department of Food Science & 
Nutrition at the University of Minnesota. This will aid you in learning something about who we are and what we do. 
We offer a short <A HREF=tour.htm>photographic tour of FScN</A> if you'd like to see what ""we"" look like. You can 
also visit our individual <a href=pages.htm>home pages</a>.<p>

In a more general sense, we also provide resources related to specific faculty, staff and student interests. We are 
attempting to provide information relative to aspects of the study of food science and nutrition, in general. This 
will range from our K12 page (providing links to some of the K12 programs we are involved in) to our Food-Law page 
(providing information and links to sites relating to food law).<p>

Finally, we provide a variety of specific resources to support our students, staff and faculty. This would include 
materials for specific classes, newsletters and other announcements, and whatever other aids and links we can develop 
to make our lives more coherent.<p>

These pages are continually growing and changing. We are trying to find ways to make our information more obvious and 
readily useful. We are in the midst of a new metamorphosis. As the pages shift and reshape themselves, I welcome your 
feedback. Whether you are just web hopping, or a professional food scientist or nutritionist, I invite you to sign our

<font size=+2>S</font><font size=+1>cience and </font>
<font size=+2>N</font><font size=+1>utrition</font>
 offers <A HREF=under.htm>undergraduate</A> and 
<A HREF=grad.htm>graduate</A> programs in Nutrition and in Food Science that prepare students 
for careers related to food and health. Students graduate from the 
undergraduate programs with a Bachelor of Science degree.  Students may 
obtain either Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy degrees from 
graduate programs. <p>
The studies of nutrition and food science cover the food continuum from 
the producer to the consumer, including food processing, product 
development, food distribution and marketing, its preparation and 
serving, and the nutrition of people as it relates to health, the 
prevention of chronic diseases and their treatment.  <p>

The Department of Food Science and Nutrition is jointly administered by 
the <A HREF=http://beauty.agoff.umn.edu:80/~coafes/>College of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Science (CAFES)</a> and 
the <A HREF=http://www.che.umn.edu>College of Human Ecology (CHE)</a> 
and the Food Science Program and the Nutrition Program are open to 
students registered in either College.  <p>

These pages serve a number of functions. First, you will find information about the Department of Food Science &amp; 
Nutrition at the University of Minnesota. This will aid you in learning something about who we are and what we do. 
We offer a short <a href=""tour.htm"">photographic tour of FScN</a> if you'd like to see what ""we"" look like. You can 
also visit our individual <a href=""pages.htm"">home pages</a>.<p>

In a more general sense, we also provide resources related to specific faculty, staff and student interests. We are 
attempting to provide information relative to aspects of the study of food science and nutrition, in general. This 
will range from our K12 page (providing links to some of the K12 programs we are involved in) to our Food-Law page 
(providing information and links to sites relating to food law).<p>

Finally, we provide a variety of specific resources to support our students, staff and faculty. This would include 
materials for specific classes, newsletters and other announcements, and whatever other aids and links we can develop 
to make our lives more coherent.<p>

These pages are continually growing and changing. We are trying to find ways to make our information more obvious and 
readily useful. We are in the midst of a new metamorphosis. As the pages shift and reshape themselves, I welcome your 
feedback. Whether you are just web hopping, or a professional food scientist or nutritionist, I invite you to sign our

 offers <a href=""under.htm"">undergraduate</a> and 
<a href=""grad.htm"">graduate</a> programs in Nutrition and in Food Science that prepare students 
for careers related to food and health. Students graduate from the 
undergraduate programs with a Bachelor of Science degree.  Students may 
obtain either Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy degrees from 
graduate programs. <p>
The studies of nutrition and food science cover the food continuum from 
the producer to the consumer, including food processing, product 
development, food distribution and marketing, its preparation and 
serving, and the nutrition of people as it relates to health, the 
prevention of chronic diseases and their treatment.  <p>

The Department of Food Science and Nutrition is jointly administered by 
the <a href=""http://beauty.agoff.umn.edu:80/~coafes/"">College of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Science (CAFES)</a> and 
the <a href=""http://www.che.umn.edu"">College of Human Ecology (CHE)</a> 
and the Food Science Program and the Nutrition Program are open to 
students registered in either College.  <p>

<H3><A NAME=""PROFILE"">Company Profile</A></H3>
RTP is a technology development company.  The primary business focus of RTP is to acquire, develop, and out-license novel pharmaceutical products and technologies that offer significant medical and health care benefits.  Among other innovations, the <A HREF=""""#MICRO"""">MicroCrystal(TM)</A> drug delivery system for water-insoluble drugs is RTP's flagship technology.
<BR>
<A HREF=""#TOC"">ToC</A>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME=""MICRO"">MicroCrystal</A></H3>
<H4><A NAME=""MICRO1"">Technology Profile</A></H4>
MicroCrystal(TM) technology consists of encapsulation of a water-insoluble pharmaceutical agent in natural or semi-synthetic phospholipids. The final product is a very fine aqueous suspension of submicron-sized (0.3 to 1.0 micron) phospholipid-coated drug -- MicroCrystals. The components used in MicroCrystal technology are biocompatible and are classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Generally Recognized As Safe. Both liquid and lyophilized dosage forms are available.
<P>
The concept of using phospholipids for drug delivery has intrigued scientists for decades. After years of research, RTP has successfully devised a lipid-based drug delivery system for oral, parenteral, or topical administration of hydrophobic compounds.
</P>
<BR>
<A HREF=""#TOC"">ToC</A>
<H4><A NAME=""MICRO2"">Advantages of MicroCrystal Technology</A></H4>
The MicroCrystal drug delivery system offer many advantages over other drug drug delivery systems. These advantages ranges from payload capacity to marketing exclusivity. RTP is committed to the MicroCrystal drug delivery system.
<BR>
<A HREF=""#TOC"">ToC</A>
<H4><A NAME=""MICRO3"">MicroCrystal Technology vs. Liposomes</A></H4>
Unlike liposomes, which are primarily meant to entrap water-soluble agents, MicroCrystal formulations are ideal for water-insoluble drugs.

The goal of a drug delivery system is to provide a patient-friendly formulation that is capable of delivering medically relevant amounts of drug. The versatility and reliability of the MicroCrystal technology provide many advantages over formulations that employ organic solvents and detergents to achieve adequate drug payloads.
<BR>
<A HREF=""#TOC"">ToC</A>
<H4><A NAME=""MICRO4"">Oral Availability</A></H4>
Improvement if oral availability using MicroCrystal technology has been demonstrated in dog and rat models with various drugs that are known to have poor oral availability. For example, MicroCrystal-formulated acyclovir in a cross-over study with sonicated bulk suspensions. In animal models, the bioavailability of acyclovir increased by 76%, and the bioavailablity of cefuroxime increased by 385%.
<BR>
<A HREF=""#TOC"">ToC</A>
<H4><A NAME=""MICRO5"">Payload Capacity</A></H4>
MicroCrystal technology produces high concentrations (up to 200 mg/mL) of physiologically compatible oral and parenteral formulations. MicroCrystal formulations may be lyophilized for subsequent reconstitution, pressed into tablets, or filled into capsules.
<BR>
<A HREF=""#TOC"">ToC</A>
<H4><A NAME=""MICRO6"">Sustained Release</A></H4>
Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of MicroCrystal formulations provide a tissue-compatible, sustained release lasting 12 to 96 hours. The slow release pattern results from encapsulation of the raw drug with phospholipids. Additional advantages of MicrCrystal sustained release include consistent blood levels of drug and high tissue compatibility.
<BR>
<A HREF=""#TOC"">ToC</A>
<H4><A NAME=""MICRO7"">Immediate Release</A></H4>
MicroCrystal technology delivers immediate release of drug through intravenous dosing. The rapid dilution of MicroCrystals improves the binding process of drug to plasma proteins. 
<BR>
<A HREF=""#TOC"">ToC</A>
<H4><A NAME=""MICRO8"">Toxicity</A></H4>
Pilot intravenous toxicity sudies in rats show that the dose-dependent toxicity profiles of MicroCrystal formulations are identical to those seen with drugs that are not formulated using MicroCrystal technology. Additionally, in an acute toxicity study in rabbits (Draize Test), MicroCrystal-formulated drugs failed to produce significant irritation. These results indicate that no additional toxic effects are produced by the components of the MicroCrystal formulations.
<BR>
<A HREF=""#TOC"">ToC</A>
<H4><A NAME=""MICRO9"">Marketing Exclusivity</A></H4>
Through extensive U.S. and internationally issued and pending patents, MicroCrystal techology offers a patentable drug delivery system. For drugs approaching off-patent status, MicroCrystal technology offers a potential patent-extension strategy. MicroCrystal formulations can be commercially manufactured using currently available equipment and excipients.
<BR>
<A HREF=""#TOC"">ToC</A>
<H4><A NAME=""MICRO10"">Conclusion</A></H4>
Versatility and reliability are essential elements of successful drug delivery systems. The MicroCrystal drug delivery system offers the following advantages:
<UL>
<LI>applicable to all dosing routes</LI>
<LI>reduces toxicity of parenteral formulations by eliminating the need for organic solvents or extreme pH</LI>
<LI>improved oral bioavailability offers the opportunity to convert parenteral-only formulations to oral formulations</LI>
<LI>may lower the required oral dose for drugs that are poorly absorbed</LI>
<LI>enables the commercialization of otherwise therapeutically effective drugs whose development has been halted due to difficulties in formulation or lack of appropriate bioavailability</LI>
<LI>the manufacturing process is relatively simple and is readily amenable to commercial scale production</LI>
<LI>extensive patent protection offers a unique product-line extension strategy</LI>

Over the past fifteen years, modern science has made great strides in the treatment
of baldness.
<p>
Unfortunately, as new developments have come to light, many patients and physicians
still turn to old, ineffective, painful and sometimes even dangerous ways of curing
hair loss.
<p>
As an experienced physician who has successfully treated thousands for hair loss,
I have prepared this web site to provide accurate information on the safe, painless,
and effective method of stopping -- and reversing -- this condition.

Welcome to <B>HospitalWeb</B>, a small but growing list of Hospitals on the Web.  
This list is being compiled with the hope that more hospitals will take advantage of the amazing 
potential of the World Wide Web.  Providing a <B>simple</B> and 
globally accessible way for <B>patients</B>, <B>medical researchers</B>, and <B>physicians</B> to get information on any hospital 
in the world is the goal.  

<hr>
This list is of ""main"" webservers (only <B>webservers</B> at <B>hospitals</B> will be 
listed).  Some hospitals currently have only scattered departmental webservers online 
(due to the ""grassroots"" nature of the WWW, servers tend to spring up without 
""top-level"" administrative approval...[grin]), so I will 
include them as need be. This list is definitely not complete.  If you run or know of 
a hospital webserver, please <A HREF=""mailto:lester@helix.mgh.harvard.edu"">send me mail</A> and I will add it immediately!  
This list is very small, but l expect it will grow quickly (if you work at a hospital 
that doesn't have a webserver online, be sure to show them this list!).
<hr>
<H3>Join the HospitalWeb Discussion List!</H3>
I've just set up a <B>listserv</B> for HospitalWeb.  Topics will be anything to do with 
hospitals on the Internet and the WWW, and I hope it will grow into a discussion 
forum where everyone can voice their opinions/questions about the future of 
hospitals and the Internet.  If you want to join in this forum, please 
send email to <A HREF=""mailto:hospitalweb@neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu"">hospitalweb@neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu</A> with the subject ""<B>help</B>"" for info on 
how to subscribe.

Although I've seen <B>many</B> medical resources on the Web, I've <B>never</B> seen a <B>simple and complete list 
of hospitals</b> on the web.  This has probably confused patients and physicians simply 
looking for specific hospital information (<I>lists of specialists, email addresses for 
physicians, specific departmental information, admitting information, clinical trials, maps, etc...?</I>)  Hence, I've started this list on my own, and hope that 
people will use it as a reference point.  Please <A HREF=""mailto:lester@helix.mgh.harvard.edu"">email me</A> if you have a hospital 
to include!

Welcome to <b>HospitalWeb</b>, a small but growing list of Hospitals on the Web.  
This list is being compiled with the hope that more hospitals will take advantage of the amazing 
potential of the World Wide Web.  Providing a <b>simple</b> and 
globally accessible way for <b>patients</b>, <b>medical researchers</b>, and <b>physicians</b> to get information on any hospital 
in the world is the goal.  

<hr/>
This list is of ""main"" webservers (only <b>webservers</b> at <b>hospitals</b> will be 
listed).  Some hospitals currently have only scattered departmental webservers online 
(due to the ""grassroots"" nature of the WWW, servers tend to spring up without 
""top-level"" administrative approval...[grin]), so I will 
include them as need be. This list is definitely not complete.  If you run or know of 
a hospital webserver, please <a href=""mailto:lester@helix.mgh.harvard.edu"">send me mail</a> and I will add it immediately!  
This list is very small, but l expect it will grow quickly (if you work at a hospital 
that doesn't have a webserver online, be sure to show them this list!).
<hr/>
<h3>Join the HospitalWeb Discussion List!</h3>
I've just set up a <b>listserv</b> for HospitalWeb.  Topics will be anything to do with 
hospitals on the Internet and the WWW, and I hope it will grow into a discussion 
forum where everyone can voice their opinions/questions about the future of 
hospitals and the Internet.  If you want to join in this forum, please 
send email to <a href=""mailto:hospitalweb@neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu"">hospitalweb@neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu</a> with the subject ""<b>help</b>"" for info on 
how to subscribe.

<hr/>
Although I've seen <b>many</b> medical resources on the Web, I've <b>never</b> seen a <b>simple and complete list 
of hospitals</b> on the web.  This has probably confused patients and physicians simply 
looking for specific hospital information (<i>lists of specialists, email addresses for 
physicians, specific departmental information, admitting information, clinical trials, maps, etc...?</i>)  Hence, I've started this list on my own, and hope that 
people will use it as a reference point.  Please <a href=""mailto:lester@helix.mgh.harvard.edu"">email me</a> if you have a hospital 
to include! 
<hr/>
I chaired <b>Workshop F: Webserver Applications for Hospitals and Medical Research Centers</b> 
at the <a href=""http://www.igd.fhg.de/www/www95/www95.html"">Third International WWW Conference</a> (April 1995) in Darmstadt, Germany.  For more

This site is relatively new and still under construction.  There is not as
much here now as I would like.  I'm counting on you, the visitors, to help
change that.  So, please, if you have any...<a href=""mailto:faust@access.digex.net"">send me information.</a> I'm looking
for whatever can be sent electronically (or even via snail-mail).  If you
have informational files, papers, names, addresses, manufacturer info,
sleep center info, articles - <i>whatever</i>! If you think it might be of
any interest at all to OSA sufferers, please send it.  If you have
comments or suggestions, send them, too - but no guarantees as to when
they will appear; I only have so many hours in the day.<p>

<B>Welcome to ICRIN</B>, a dynamic list of Internet accessible resources broadly related to the field
of injury research and control.  The resources are in the form of clickable hyperlinks to other sources and
documents somewhere on the Net.  New users may want to look at the ICRIN
<a href=""icrins0.htm"">slide show</a>
that presents an overview of the structure, content, and benefits of this site.<p>

If you know of other Internet resources that would be
appropriate, please fill out an <a href=""forms/addurl.htm"">Add Form</a> or post a message to the
<A HREF=""mainhb.htm"" >ICRIN HyperBoard</A> (bulletin board system) with
the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address and a short description of the resource.
ICRIN will be updated at least monthly to reflect links to the new information.  ICRIN is a user of the

Non-highlighted terms do not yet have linkages or known Internet resources.
Please note that the nature of the Net means that some links are not always
functional due to heavy traffic, changes in address, or system closure.  If you do
not get a response from a particular link, try again later.  We will also endeavor
to remove non-functional links as soon as possible.  ICRIN takes advantages of some features
found only in the <A HREF = ""http://home.mcom.com/info/how-to-get-it.html"">NETSCAPE</a> version 1.1 (or later) Web browser.<p>

Give yourself time to explore all the links presented here.  There are many interesting sites
and resources best appreciated over several sessions.

Lists are topical areas one subscribes to.  Once subscribed, members
are automatically sent E-mail copies of all
communications sent to those lists.  Generally, one subscribes by sending an E-mail message to
the <b>List Server</b> containing the following information in the message area:<p>

<dl><dd><i> subscribe LISTNAME your_first_name your_last_name</i> <p><p></dl>

You then will get further instructions that tell you how to post messages to the <b>List Address</b>,
unsubscribe, find out who is on the list, and other capabilities.<p><p>

Some of the lists archive their discussions and place them in public directories.
If this is done (and we know about it), the message archives can be examined without
necessarily signing up as a member.  This provides a means to look at the list's content
and determine whether you are interested or not in becoming a member.
If the list contents are archived the YES entry in the <b>Archived?</b> column will be highlighted
below and you can click on it to see the archive.<p>

The table below summarizes the key information you need to contact each of these lists.
Clicking on the <B>List Name</B> jumps to a description of that particular list.
To subscribe you must send an E mail message to the
<b>List Server</b>, as explained above.  If your WEB browser supports ""mail"" and you
have your E-mail address handy, you can sign up for any of these lists right now by clicking
on its respective <b>List Server</b> in the table below.  There is also the capability to
<A HREF = ""http://www.ii.uib.no/cgi-bin/paml"">search</a>

<A NAME = ""intvio-l""></A><dd><b>INTVIO-L </b> is devoted to all aspects of
family violence.  It is maintained by the Family Violence Research Team at the University
of Rhode Island.  The INTVIO-L list serves as a networking system devoted to all
aspects of family violence.  While various other lists may explore
the topics of child abuse or violence within the family, the intimate
violence list is unique in that it serves a wide range of areas that
constitute the definition of intimate violence.  This list is designed
to encompass all areas of interest regarding family violence rather
than limiting discussion to one interest.
<p><p>

<dd>
<A NAME = ""ejintvio""></A><b>EJINTVIO</b>, the Electronic Journal of Intimate Violence,
is published as a list.
Topics include physical child abuse, sexual child abuse, child neglect, physical
spouse abuse, sexual spouse abuse, psychological abuse, elder abuse, and dating violence,
as well as other related topics subscribers may wish to explore.

providers.  Although the focus is on New York State issues, often the
discussion is far broader.  For instance, a recent thread discussed the
need for CPR certification by EMT's.  When appropriate, questions are
answered by State EMS staff.  The listserv includes a number of
files of interest, including New York State laws and rules related to
EMS. List manager: John D. Lewis.

<a name=""Newsgroups""><p><LI><b>Newsgroups</b>
<dd>Newsgroups are less automated than mail lists and are generally  (but not always)
more public and read and contributed to by a more diverse audience.
If a newsgroup is established you generally have to
look at the postings, but you don't have to sign up to view the messages.
However, you may need newsreader software to take full advantage of newsgroups and
you must have access to a Usenet (NNTP) server.  Some WWW browsers like NETSCAPE
have newsreaders built in but you still need access to a Usenet server.  There are thousands
of newsgroups.  To automatically be sent copies of newsgroup messages related to a
particular topic, explore the powerful capabilities of Stanford's
<A HREF = ""http://woodstock.stanford.edu:2000/"">Netnews</A>
Information Filtering Tool (SIFT).  SIFT enables users without access to a

<center><b>WELCOME</b></center>
<b>Welcome to ICRIN</b>, a dynamic list of Internet accessible resources broadly related to the field
of injury research and control.  The resources are in the form of clickable hyperlinks to other sources and
documents somewhere on the Net.  New users may want to look at the ICRIN
<a href=""icrins0.htm"">slide show</a>
that presents an overview of the structure, content, and benefits of this site.<p>

If you know of other Internet resources that would be
appropriate, please fill out an <a href=""forms/addurl.htm"">Add Form</a> or post a message to the
<a href=""mainhb.htm"">ICRIN HyperBoard</a> (bulletin board system) with
the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address and a short description of the resource.
ICRIN will be updated at least monthly to reflect links to the new information.  ICRIN is a user of the

fields to return to the top of the index list. 
Non-highlighted terms do not yet have linkages or known Internet resources.
Please note that the nature of the Net means that some links are not always
functional due to heavy traffic, changes in address, or system closure.  If you do
not get a response from a particular link, try again later.  We will also endeavor
to remove non-functional links as soon as possible.  ICRIN takes advantages of some features
found only in the <a href=""http://home.mcom.com/info/how-to-get-it.html"">NETSCAPE</a> version 1.1 (or later) Web browser.<p>

Give yourself time to explore all the links presented here.  There are many interesting sites

<a name=""List servers""><li><b>List servers</b><p>
Lists are topical areas one subscribes to.  Once subscribed, members
are automatically sent E-mail copies of all
communications sent to those lists.  Generally, one subscribes by sending an E-mail message to
the <b>List Server</b> containing the following information in the message area:<p>
<dl><dd><i> subscribe LISTNAME your_first_name your_last_name</i> <p><p></p></p></dd></dl>

You then will get further instructions that tell you how to post messages to the <b>List Address</b>,
unsubscribe, find out who is on the list, and other capabilities.<p><p>

Some of the lists archive their discussions and place them in public directories.
If this is done (and we know about it), the message archives can be examined without
necessarily signing up as a member.  This provides a means to look at the list's content
and determine whether you are interested or not in becoming a member.
If the list contents are archived the YES entry in the <b>Archived?</b> column will be highlighted
below and you can click on it to see the archive.<p>

The table below summarizes the key information you need to contact each of these lists.
Clicking on the <b>List Name</b> jumps to a description of that particular list.
To subscribe you must send an E mail message to the
<b>List Server</b>, as explained above.  If your WEB browser supports ""mail"" and you
have your E-mail address handy, you can sign up for any of these lists right now by clicking
on its respective <b>List Server</b> in the table below.  There is also the capability to
<a href=""http://www.ii.uib.no/cgi-bin/paml"">search</a>
the thousands of public lists by key word for new or related lists.<p>

the topics of child abuse or violence within the family, the intimate
violence list is unique in that it serves a wide range of areas that
constitute the definition of intimate violence.  This list is designed
to encompass all areas of interest regarding family violence rather
than limiting discussion to one interest.

<a name=""Newsgroups""><p><li><b>Newsgroups</b>
<dd>Newsgroups are less automated than mail lists and are generally  (but not always)
more public and read and contributed to by a more diverse audience.
If a newsgroup is established you generally have to
look at the postings, but you don't have to sign up to view the messages.
However, you may need newsreader software to take full advantage of newsgroups and
you must have access to a Usenet (NNTP) server.  Some WWW browsers like NETSCAPE
have newsreaders built in but you still need access to a Usenet server.  There are thousands
of newsgroups.  To automatically be sent copies of newsgroup messages related to a
particular topic, explore the powerful capabilities of Stanford's
<a href=""http://woodstock.stanford.edu:2000/"">Netnews</a>
Information Filtering Tool (SIFT).  SIFT enables users without access to a
Usenet server to get filtered newsnet postings. Here are some Newsgroups of interest:<p>

<p>
The Lateiner Dataspace site contains 
information pertaining to research being performed at Lateiner Dataspace
on high-speed volume visualization, discrete physical simulation techniques,
and Dataspace distributed datastructures.  We invite other sites to submit
URL's on related information for incorporation into our subnet, and we
also invite the submission of materials to include.<p>

The mission of this site is to provide a reference point for information
regarding Dataspace related items, where Dataspace is a dynamic, distributed
voxel database.  This would include works dealing with the rendering of
voxel data, manipulation and simulation of voxel models, and distributed
computing algorithms.<p>

After you have finished exploring our site, feel free to submit comments
using our <A HREF=http://www.dataspace.com:84/forms/comments.html><I>

Please use the text-based or image-based navigation scripts at the top
of each page to explore our extensive World Wide Web offerings.
<P>
<h3>Update:</h3>
<p>
<a href=http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/vox-l.html>Vox-L Inc.</a> was one
of the first companies to license Lateiner Dataspace's volume rendering
technologies (the MRI images in the greeting banner were generated using
these algorithms).  Vox-L's Visualizer software has incorporated Lateiner
Dataspace technology since 1992.  In 1994, Vox-L licensed additional
technology, including an embedded version of Dataspace TM (our high-speed
volumetric object database) for use in the Vox-L Visualizer (incorporating
the database to power Vox-L's segmentation and classification tools).  In
addition, Vox-L recently licensed the Dataspace Object Manager to power the 
communication between the Vox-L Visualizer and Vox-L Extension processes
built using the Vox-L API 
(see <a href=http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/vapi/VAPI-Developer.html>for more information</a>).
<p>
Vox-L Inc. has stated that their next goal is to license Dataspace
simulation technology for incorporation into the Vox-L Visualizer to
enable enhanced Virtual Surgery applications.  To learn more
about Dataspace as a simulation environment and as a distributed
metacomputing engine, read <b><i><a href=http://www.dataspace.com/WWW/documents/interview.html>Interview with Mathematician about Dataspace</a></i></b>.

Welcome to <B>HospitalWeb</B>, a small but growing list of Hospitals on the Web.  
This list is being compiled with the hope that more hospitals will take advantage of the amazing 
potential of the World Wide Web.  Providing a <B>simple</B> and 
globally accessible way for <B>patients</B>, <B>medical researchers</B>, and <B>physicians</B> to get information on any hospital 
in the world is the goal.  

<hr>
This list is of ""main"" webservers (only <B>webservers</B> at <B>hospitals</B> will be 
listed).  Some hospitals currently have only scattered departmental webservers online 
(due to the ""grassroots"" nature of the WWW, servers tend to spring up without 
""top-level"" administrative approval...[grin]), so I will 
include them as need be. This list is definitely not complete.  If you run or know of 
a hospital webserver, please <A HREF=""mailto:lester@helix.mgh.harvard.edu"">send me mail</A> and I will add it immediately!  
This list is very small, but l expect it will grow quickly (if you work at a hospital 
that doesn't have a webserver online, be sure to show them this list!).

Although I've seen <B>many</B> medical resources on the Web, I've <B>never</B> seen a <B>simple and complete list

looking for specific hospital information (<I>lists of specialists, email addresses for 
physicians, specific departmental information, admitting information, clinical trials, maps, etc...?</I>)  Hence, I've started this list on my own, and hope that 
people will use it as a reference point.  Please <A HREF=""mailto:lester@helix.mgh.harvard.edu"">email me</A> if you have a hospital

Welcome to <b>HospitalWeb</b>, a small but growing list of Hospitals on the Web.  
This list is being compiled with the hope that more hospitals will take advantage of the amazing 
potential of the World Wide Web.  Providing a <b>simple</b> and 
globally accessible way for <b>patients</b>, <b>medical researchers</b>, and <b>physicians</b> to get information on any hospital 
in the world is the goal.  

<hr/>
This list is of ""main"" webservers (only <b>webservers</b> at <b>hospitals</b> will be 
listed).  Some hospitals currently have only scattered departmental webservers online 
(due to the ""grassroots"" nature of the WWW, servers tend to spring up without

include them as need be. This list is definitely not complete.  If you run or know of

Although I've seen <b>many</b> medical resources on the Web, I've <b>never</b> seen a <b>simple and complete list

looking for specific hospital information (<i>lists of specialists, email addresses for 
physicians, specific departmental information, admitting information, clinical trials, maps, etc...?</i>)  Hence, I've started this list on my own, and hope that 
people will use it as a reference point.  Please <a href=""mailto:lester@helix.mgh.harvard.edu"">email me</a> if you have a hospital

<H1>Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death</H1>


<H3>Hello and Welcome!</H3>

<p> This page is currently under development, but stayed tuned for
more improvements.  My name is <A
href=""http://www.cis.yale.edu/~xdenner/xdenner.html"">Alex Denner
(denner@yale.edu)</A> and I am doing research in the prediction of
sudden cardiac death at Yale.  Also, I would like to hear from anyone
who is doing similar work or is interested in the field.  (See below.)

<p>
I am conducting research on: Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility
to Sudden Cardiac Death.  This involves analyzing electrocardiograms
to determine the likelihood of future episodes of ventricular
fibrillation.  Soon I will put more information about my work here.</p>

<p> An electrocardiogram represents the electric potential, usually on
the surface of the chest, that comes from the heart muscle.  The heart
is comprised of four chambers.  Blood enters the heart into the two
atria (left and right) and goes to the two ventricles (left and
right).  The two atria contract simultaneously then, after a short
delay, the ventricular muscles contract.  On the electrocardiogram
""waves"" can be seen which indicate the atrial contract, ventricular
contraction, and, since the ventricles are large muscles, often the
ventricular repolarization can be seen.  Currently, my work is
concentrating on ventricular arrythmias, specifically the most
serious, ventricular fibrillation.  Fibrillation is a state of the
heart where the ventricular muscle fibers appear to be contracting and
relaxing at random---they are not acting synchronously.  During
fibrillation no blood is pumped by the heart. </p>

<P>
<A HREF=""ecg.ps"">This is an electrocardiogram from a Holter monitor</A>
(It is a postscript file.)
</P>

<p>
I am trying to find a way to analyze the electrocardiogram to predict
the likelihood of a given patient having an episode of ventricular
fibrillation sometime in the future.  One of my favored techniques
is wavelet analysis which allows the frequency content of the signal to
be distinguished spatially. </p>

My name is [Alex Denner(denner@yale.edu)](http://www.cis.yale.edu/~xdenner/xdenner.html) and I am doing research in the prediction ofsudden cardiac death at Yale. Also, I would like to hear from anyonewho is doing similar work or is interested in the field. (See below.)

I am conducting research on: Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibilityto Sudden Cardiac Death. This involves analyzing electrocardiogramsto determine the likelihood of future episodes of ventricularfibrillation. Soon I will put more information about my work here.

The Center for Advanced Instructional Media (C/AIM) was founded in 1987 to explore the educational potential of new interactive multimedia computing technology. Our recent focus has been on software design for educational applications in cardiology, human anatomy, nuclear medicine, avian anatomy, and other biomedical topics. The Center's current research interests are in self-assessment in medical education, and an exploration of visual quantification skills in medical imaging.<P>

<H1><A HREF=""/""><IMG SRC=""/images/ycmi-shield-68x74i.gif"" ALT=""YCMI"" ALIGN=MIDDLE></A> The MED &amp; Yale</H1>

The Medical Entities Dictionary (MED) is a structured medical
vocabulary developed at Columbia University.  These Web pages
are intended for internal use by those looking at aspects of the MED,
and how it might relate to medical vocabularies at Yale.  
We have left them publicly accessible
because they might be of some interest to others, and there seemed no
reason to hide them; outside users should be aware and forgiving of
their primitive state.

<h2>MED Background and Details</h2>

There are several query and online reference functions available:

<dl>
<dt><strong><u>General</u></strong>
<dd>These items cover general aspects of the MED.

	<li><A HREF=""/cgi-bin/yale.query1"">Run Queries - Yale Lab</A>
	Try out the test version, which runs queries on our local Sybase Release 10 Server.
	Initially, this interface is intended for running predefined stored
	procedures, examples of which are given on the next screen.  Once the
	""forms"" interface is available for the Macintosh -- supposedly, any day
	now -- it will be used to create a friendlier and more flexible system.

<H1>Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death</H1>


<H3>Hello and Welcome!</H3>

<p> This page is currently under development, but stayed tuned for
more improvements.  My name is <A
href=""http://www.cis.yale.edu/~xdenner/xdenner.html"">Alex Denner
(denner@yale.edu)</A> and I am doing research in the prediction of
sudden cardiac death at Yale.  Also, I would like to hear from anyone
who is doing similar work or is interested in the field.  (See below.)

<p>
I am conducting research on: Non-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility
to Sudden Cardiac Death.  This involves analyzing electrocardiograms
to determine the likelihood of future episodes of ventricular
fibrillation.  Soon I will put more information about my work here.</p>

<p> An electrocardiogram represents the electric potential, usually on
the surface of the chest, that comes from the heart muscle.  The heart
is comprised of four chambers.  Blood enters the heart into the two
atria (left and right) and goes to the two ventricles (left and
right).  The two atria contract simultaneously then, after a short
delay, the ventricular muscles contract.  On the electrocardiogram
""waves"" can be seen which indicate the atrial contract, ventricular
contraction, and, since the ventricles are large muscles, often the
ventricular repolarization can be seen.  Currently, my work is
concentrating on ventricular arrythmias, specifically the most
serious, ventricular fibrillation.  Fibrillation is a state of the
heart where the ventricular muscle fibers appear to be contracting and
relaxing at random---they are not acting synchronously.  During
fibrillation no blood is pumped by the heart. </p>

<P>
<A HREF=""ecg.ps"">This is an electrocardiogram from a Holter monitor</A>
(It is a postscript file.)
</P>

<p>
I am trying to find a way to analyze the electrocardiogram to predict
the likelihood of a given patient having an episode of ventricular
fibrillation sometime in the future.  One of my favored techniques
is wavelet analysis which allows the frequency content of the signal to
be distinguished spatially. </p>

 ASM Journals</h3>
<hr>
<p>


<p>

The American Society for Microbiology has traditionally produced superior-quality journals
covering the entire spectrum of microbiology.  These publications maintain the highest standards
of excellence, whether for reviews or for basic research articles, and attract authors who are
highly respected worldwide.  <p>

<p>

<b>ASM journals are available in both print and on CD-ROM.</b>  For 1996 subscriptions, the CD-ROM format is available for Windows and Macintosh.  The CD-ROM version is mailed
monthly, just like the printed version.  The system can display and print both ASCII text and
exact page images and allows viewers to perform a variety of full-text searches.  Command line
languages are English, French, Spanish, and German.  At the end of a subscription year, archival
CD-ROMs are available for easy storage.<p>

<p>

<b>Member  Subscriptions:</b>

ASM members receive member rates on the journal subscriptions and a credit that can apply  to
the journal(s) of your choice.  <p>

<ul><h3><dl><dt><a href=""ftp://ftp.wehi.edu.au/pub/biology/who_dbase/"">Anonymous FTP site</a></dt></dl></h3><dd>This site contains a number of text files of nucleotide and protein sequence data. In one directory <a href=""ftp://ftp.wehi.edu.au/pub/biology/who_dbase/current_version"">directory</a> I list files that were included in the last mailout. In another <a href=""ftp://ftp.wehi.edu.au/pub/biology/who_dbase/new_since_last_mailout"">directory</a> are files added since then. <br/>If you use the links below to grab any file, be aware that you will be getting the version sent in the last mailout, so you just may want to check the <a href=""ftp://ftp.wehi.edu.au/pub/biology/who_dbase/new_since_last_mailout"">new directory </a>to see if there is anything later. The files exist in several different formats:   
<ul><li> <a href=""ftp://ftp.wehi.edu.au/pub/biology/who_dbase/current_version/annotnuc.dat"">Annotated Nucleotide sequences in EMBL format.</a> Beware that this is a <b>very large file</b> occupying about 4 Mb at last count. 
<li><a href=""ftp://ftp.wehi.edu.au/pub/biology/who_dbase/gcg"">Annotated Nucleotide sequences in GCG format.</a> Note: this directory contains thousands of files and takes a while to list in your web browser.
<li><a href=""ftp://ftp.wehi.edu.au/pub/biology/who_dbase/current_version/pcnuc.dat"">Unannotated nucleotide sequences suitable for importation into PC programs</a>

<H2>INFORMATION</H2>
Genetic centre, with 2500 of goats and
2500 of sheep, is situated in the hill-
country in the vicintly of Buzet. The 
Centre is still under construction and
when finished its business activity will
include sheep and goats-breeding for
obtaining meat, milk, wool addition
through growth as well as for production
of cheese. It is generally anticipated 
that when the Centre will be completely
finished, approximately 65% of the
annual production will be exported,
primarily to Italy, but also to the Europe-
an Community countries. The Centre is
now in the phase of arranging producti-
on, organizational, professional and
technical conditions for its work. At the
moment there are 6 workers employed.

* The Centre is still under construction
   and therefore has no income.<p>

SWALLOWED A FLY
(Alan Mills?)

I knew an old lady who swallowed a fly
     Perhaps she'll die.

I knew an old lady who swallowed a spider
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
     Perhaps she'll die.

I knew an old lady who swallowed a cat
Just think of that! She swallowed a cat.
She swallowed the cat to catch the spider
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
I don't know why she swallowed the fly
     Perhaps she'll die.

I knew an old lady who swallowed a dog
Oh what a hog! To swallow a dog,
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat
She swallowed the cat to catch the spider
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
I don't know why she swallowed the fly
     Perhaps she'll die.

I knew an old lady who swallowed a goat
She just opened her throat and swallowed a goat
She swallowed the goat to catch the dog
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat
She swallowed the cat to catch the spider
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
I don't know why she swallowed the fly
     Perhaps she'll die.

I knew and old lady who swallowed a horse
(spoken) She died, of course.

Note: I've heard improvs with other animals, but this seems to be
     the core story. RG

<h2>Pulp Fiction</H2>

<H3>May 21st</h3>

Took it easy today. Went to the video store and picked up Pulp Fiction to watch later that evening! <p>

On the way into Liverpool 3 weeks ago I noticed a pub called The Goat. With such a stupid name, me and Mike decided now would be a good time to check it out. Well, did we get a shock! What a load of shit! The shittiest tiny little pub I've seen so far in England! Still, I had to get a photo outside it, and that we did! Trying not to laugh too much! ;-) Oh well, I guess there's probably hundreds more pubs like it all over the country!<p>

Mike hadn't seen Pulp Fiction, so we sat down to watch it that night. It's a kick-ass film, no matter how many times you've seen it! I love it! And Mike is now a Tarantino fan too! ;-)<p>

The instructor caught my attention with a story about two Chinese generals at the time of the Mongol invasion (c. 1272).  One ended up collaborating with the invaders, the other relinquished all his titles and wealth and went up into the mountains to herd goats.  A well-known master painter illustrated this with a simple brush drawing of a sheep and a goat, the animals symbolizing the respective spirits of these generals.  I painted a lot of bad paintings of sheep and goats before I managed to get this one good one.  Whether or not it ended up being anything about Chinese generals is another story....<P>

FERAL GOATS IN AUSTRALIA: AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY

PREPARED BY JUDITH NEWLAND  B.V.Sc., Grad. Dip. LIM

INTRODUCTION
<P>
PREFACE
<P>
The earliest recorded arrival of goats in Australia was with the
First Fleet in 1788. Goats are exceptionally hardy animals able
to survive and reproduce on poor quality feed and limited water.
These very traits that made goats indispensable to the early settlers
are the qualities that now make the feral goat an environmental
menace.
<P>
The versatile, easily handled, domesticated goat accompanied the
pioneers, the miners and the railway gangs to wide areas of Australia.
The goat was a ready source of milk and meat and in some places
goats were used for light haulage and racing. An early mohair
industry added to introductions in Victoria and Western Australia.
As the country developed the settlers turned to cows for milk,
and sheep and cattle for meat. The wool industry rapidly supplanted
the early mohair industry. Unwanted goats were often set free
or escaped to form the basis of today's feral herds.
<P>
This bibliography covers the broad subject of feral goats in Australia.
Material listed is from a variety of sources: monographs, journals,
conference proceedings, working papers, newspaper reports. It
includes history, distribution, control methods, diseases, exploitation
for meat, fibre and hides and the environmental impact of feral
goats. Research programs on biological behaviour and production
potential are included. Newspaper articles report on the emotional
response of the general public to feral goats and on the efforts
of agricultural extension workers.
<P>
Through the bibliography the changing attitudes towards feral
goats and care for the environment can be traced. During the 1960s
the approach to goat control in some areas was by poisoning watering
holes with arsenic, whereas the 1990s approach is towards the
development of an effective strategic management plan integrated
with ecologically sustainable land management. The different attitudes
of pastoralists and conservationists are highlighted. The pastoralists
despise the goat because it competes for grazing with domestic
sheep and cattle while acknowledging that in times of drought
they make more money from killing feral goats for the meat trade
than from sheep or cattle. The conservationists are concerned
with the goat's role in destruction of native flora, competition
with native fauna and erosion of the land.
<P>
In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in feral
goats as a source of cashmere, as the base stock for upgrading
Angora flocks, and as a source of meat for the export trade. These
developments are all reflected by the material listed in this
bibliography.
<P>
LEVEL
<P>
This bibliography aims to provide information of use to a variety
of groups with varying levels of interest in feral goat control
and/or exploitation. It provides references for professional officers
working with feral animal control programs, biological behaviour
and disease control programs. Material is listed of importance
to the pastoral community interested in exploiting feral goats
for meat, fibre and weed control. Conservationists are provided
with references on environmental impact.
<P>
LIMITATIONS
<P>
The bibliography was limited to material published in English
about feral goats in Australia. There was no set chronological
period covered. Miscellaneous fact sheets published by State Departments
of Agriculture, and some Western Australia and South Australian
minor magazines containing references to feral goats were not
readily available in Canberra and are not included in the bibliography.
<P>
ARRANGEMENT
<P>
Arrangement of the bibliography is under broad subject headings
to make it relatively easy to find an area of interest. Secondary
arrangement is chronological by date of publication. Ascending
order of publication emphasises the historical attitudinal changes
to feral goats and environmental management. Newspaper and hobby-farmer
magazine articles are listed under the one heading. Items giving
a general overview on many different aspects of feral goats are
listed together.

<P>
  &quot;Diet of feral goats was recorded by direct observation
in a shrub-dominated Eucalyptus populnea woodland in New South
Wales on 7 sampling occasions during 2 years. Different nutritional
opportunities were provided by the effects of rainfall on 4 contrasting
grazing treatments. The goats foraged evenly over the paddocks
and encountered most foods with the same frequency as they occurred.
With unlimited quantities of forage available the goats spent
63% of their time grazing and only 28% browsing. Most browsing
took place in dry conditions when pasture quality was low. When
forage was in short supply the goats accepted some shrubs not
normally eaten, and these plants died; other woody plants were
eaten erratically or not at all. Acacia aneura was the only woody
plant which was palatable and resilient to goat browsing. Goats
mostly ate the same plant species as sheep and with the same preference,
but tended to eat more browse than sheep in dry times. The browse
consumed was principally the same as that consumed by sheep, demonstrating
sequential competition for dry-season fodder. Goats demonstrated
a potential for overgrazing in dry times, indicating that stocking
rates must be adjusted at such times to avoid pastures becoming
extinct.&quot;

  &quot;Measurements indexing the mating system, home range, peri-parturient
behaviour, and group size and composition of feral goats were
used to compare studied populations. Geographically diverse populations
were similar in most behavioural characteristics and their social
systems had similar structures. However, post-partum behaviour
and mating systems showed both quantitative and qualitative differences
between populations. These similarities and differences are discussed
in relation to the diverse selection history of feral goats. It
is postulated that selective changes occurring during domestication
may contribute to the variability observed in post-partum behaviour
and mating systems.&quot;

to correlate prevalence of CLA in W. A. feral goats with that
encountered in surveys in Queensland, New South Wales and South
Australia. Discusses lesions, sites of lesions, bacteria involved,
reasons for discrepancy between presence of lesions and positive
antibody titres. Notes post mortem inspection did not include
head and neck. Refers to reports of high incidence of head and
neck lesions in domestic goats. Concludes true prevalence of CLA
in feral goats in all states is likely to be higher than reported
as routine post mortem inspections have not included lymph nodes
of head and neck. Suggests future surveys include examination
of entire carcase.

<P>
 With prices for feral goats exceeding prices for sheep; goats
are no longer seen as vermin but as an important alternative income
source for pastoralists in semi-arid and arid areas of Western
Australia. This study examines the distribution and prevalence
of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) and considers the significance
of feral goats as a potential source of infection for sheep or
goats. Results showed that of 2920 feral goats slaughtered at
a Perth abattoir in 1984, 7.8% had lesions of CLA. Of the affected
goats, 49.3% had head, 46.7% body and 12.3% visceral lesions.
Results were compared with previously reported data from sheep
and significant differences are discussed. Head lesions were common
in goats but absent in sheep; lung lesions were less common in
goats than sheep; carcase lesions was similar in both species
while multiple lesions were less common in goats than in sheep.

 Author's summary:
<P>
  &quot;Caseous lymphadenitis was the most frequently encountered
pathological condition in 3,720 feral goats examined during routine
meat inspection procedures. Among nine separate consignments of
animals the prevalence of infection averaged 7.4% (range 0.3%-18.8%).
The majority of lesions were seen in lymph modes draining superficial
body areas although many also occurred in internal modes and organs.
Corynebacterium ovis was isolated from 25 of 32 lesions submitted
for bacteriological examination. Other conditions regularly encountered
included pneumonia, cysticercosis, sarcosporidiosis and lice infestation,
while myonecrosis, pleurisy, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis,
cirrhosis and mite infestation were only occasionally found. A
total of 171 serum samples were collected and tested against 17
antigens. Samples from 57.9% and 51.5% showed positive serological
reactions to the antigens for sarcosporidiosis and Q fever respectively.&quot;

  &quot;This discussion points out that the immediate potential
of Australian feral goats for economic cashmere production is
limited, and considers the use of the Angora to improve the performance
of feral goats. The present breeding policy of the Australian
mohair industry is directed towards increasing fleece weight and
body cover, and fibre diameter has increased. It is suggested
that more use should be made of fine and superfine fleeced Angoras
that are present in Australia.&quot;

  &quot;A scheme developed to encourage landowners to develop
goat enterprises has been successful in demonstrating that goats
can be used to open up heavily scrub infested rangelands in the
Cobar region, and give a reasonable financial return on the investment
required in special fencing to confine them. The areas selected
were dominated by scrub species acceptable to goats: 2 species
in particular, narrow leaved hopbush (Dodonea [Dodonaea] attenuata)
and the juvenile form of mulga (Acacia aneura), occur at spacings
of 2-5 m, with mulga thickets often occupying large areas. These
areas occur widely in shrub invaded poplar box (Eucalyptus populnea)/Acacia
woodland across N. and W. New South Wales. Fencing and management
of feral goats to encourage the return of grass and herbage species,
and a continuing supply of young mulga browse, are described.
Goats can be selected for cashmere, and the breeding of a dual
purpose meat/cashmere goat is envisaged.&quot;

  &quot;Fleece samples were taken from several body sites of 23
feral goats. The samples were dehaired, and measurements made
of down diameter and its distribution. These were compared with
measurements made on composite samples drawn from the total fleece
of each animal. Samples taken from the hip gave the most accurate
estimate of down diameter of fleeces of av. diameter, but midside
samples were better over the range of diameters exhibited by these
goats. None of the sites was very suitable for estimating the
diameter of extreme fibres, or the fibre diameter distribution.
The repeatabilities of the various measurements were generally
high. Production measurements recorded in 2yr from 20 of these
goats show that diameter, yield and weight of down had high repeatabilities,
but diameter distribution and length of down were not repeatable
over years.&quot;

 Author's abstract:
<P>
  &quot;The density of feral goats in about 234sqkm of arid rangeland
used for sheep grazing in South Australia was estimated by means
of a mark-resight technique. Marking and subsequent resighting
were done at watering points. The Petersen estimate was 4.4 goats
per square kilometre; adjustment to allow for non-random behaviour
raised this estimate to 5.0/sqkm. Maximum allowable sheep density
is 12/sqkm. The goat density we observed imposes an added burden
on the vegetation. The densities of red and western grey kangaroos,
when added together, approximate that of goats. Rabbits are virtually
absent. The long-term effects of the total grazing pressure on
the vegetation cannot be predicted in detail but will probably
be deleterious.&quot;

INTRODUCTION
<p>
PREFACE
<p>
The earliest recorded arrival of goats in Australia was with the
First Fleet in 1788. Goats are exceptionally hardy animals able
to survive and reproduce on poor quality feed and limited water.
These very traits that made goats indispensable to the early settlers
are the qualities that now make the feral goat an environmental
menace.
<p>
The versatile, easily handled, domesticated goat accompanied the
pioneers, the miners and the railway gangs to wide areas of Australia.
The goat was a ready source of milk and meat and in some places
goats were used for light haulage and racing. An early mohair
industry added to introductions in Victoria and Western Australia.
As the country developed the settlers turned to cows for milk,
and sheep and cattle for meat. The wool industry rapidly supplanted
the early mohair industry. Unwanted goats were often set free
or escaped to form the basis of today's feral herds.
<p>
This bibliography covers the broad subject of feral goats in Australia.
Material listed is from a variety of sources: monographs, journals,
conference proceedings, working papers, newspaper reports. It
includes history, distribution, control methods, diseases, exploitation
for meat, fibre and hides and the environmental impact of feral
goats. Research programs on biological behaviour and production
potential are included. Newspaper articles report on the emotional
response of the general public to feral goats and on the efforts
of agricultural extension workers.
<p>
Through the bibliography the changing attitudes towards feral
goats and care for the environment can be traced. During the 1960s
the approach to goat control in some areas was by poisoning watering
holes with arsenic, whereas the 1990s approach is towards the
development of an effective strategic management plan integrated
with ecologically sustainable land management. The different attitudes
of pastoralists and conservationists are highlighted. The pastoralists
despise the goat because it competes for grazing with domestic
sheep and cattle while acknowledging that in times of drought
they make more money from killing feral goats for the meat trade
than from sheep or cattle. The conservationists are concerned
with the goat's role in destruction of native flora, competition
with native fauna and erosion of the land.
<p>
In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in feral
goats as a source of cashmere, as the base stock for upgrading
Angora flocks, and as a source of meat for the export trade. These
developments are all reflected by the material listed in this
bibliography.
<p>
LEVEL
<p>
This bibliography aims to provide information of use to a variety
of groups with varying levels of interest in feral goat control
and/or exploitation. It provides references for professional officers
working with feral animal control programs, biological behaviour
and disease control programs. Material is listed of importance
to the pastoral community interested in exploiting feral goats
for meat, fibre and weed control. Conservationists are provided
with references on environmental impact.
<p>
LIMITATIONS
<p>
The bibliography was limited to material published in English
about feral goats in Australia. There was no set chronological
period covered. Miscellaneous fact sheets published by State Departments
of Agriculture, and some Western Australia and South Australian
minor magazines containing references to feral goats were not
readily available in Canberra and are not included in the bibliography.
<p>
ARRANGEMENT
<p>
Arrangement of the bibliography is under broad subject headings
to make it relatively easy to find an area of interest. Secondary
arrangement is chronological by date of publication. Ascending
order of publication emphasises the historical attitudinal changes
to feral goats and environmental management. Newspaper and hobby-farmer
magazine articles are listed under the one heading. Items giving
a general overview on many different aspects of feral goats are
listed together.

<p>
  ""Diet of feral goats was recorded by direct observation
in a shrub-dominated Eucalyptus populnea woodland in New South
Wales on 7 sampling occasions during 2 years. Different nutritional
opportunities were provided by the effects of rainfall on 4 contrasting
grazing treatments. The goats foraged evenly over the paddocks
and encountered most foods with the same frequency as they occurred.
With unlimited quantities of forage available the goats spent
63% of their time grazing and only 28% browsing. Most browsing
took place in dry conditions when pasture quality was low. When
forage was in short supply the goats accepted some shrubs not
normally eaten, and these plants died; other woody plants were
eaten erratically or not at all. Acacia aneura was the only woody
plant which was palatable and resilient to goat browsing. Goats
mostly ate the same plant species as sheep and with the same preference,
but tended to eat more browse than sheep in dry times. The browse
consumed was principally the same as that consumed by sheep, demonstrating
sequential competition for dry-season fodder. Goats demonstrated
a potential for overgrazing in dry times, indicating that stocking
rates must be adjusted at such times to avoid pastures becoming
extinct.""

  ""Measurements indexing the mating system, home range, peri-parturient

used to compare studied populations. Geographically diverse populations
were similar in most behavioural characteristics and their social
systems had similar structures. However, post-partum behaviour
and mating systems showed both quantitative and qualitative differences
between populations. These similarities and differences are discussed
in relation to the diverse selection history of feral goats. It
is postulated that selective changes occurring during domestication
may contribute to the variability observed in post-partum behaviour
and mating systems.""

pp. 385-386.
<p>
 Presents results of a survey of 900 feral goats processed through
an export abattoir in Western Australia demonstrating 3.1% of
goats had caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) lesions in lymph nodes or
organs while 13.7% had positive antibody titres. Survey was conducted
to correlate prevalence of CLA in W. A. feral goats with that
encountered in surveys in Queensland, New South Wales and South
Australia. Discusses lesions, sites of lesions, bacteria involved,
reasons for discrepancy between presence of lesions and positive
antibody titres. Notes post mortem inspection did not include
head and neck. Refers to reports of high incidence of head and
neck lesions in domestic goats. Concludes true prevalence of CLA
in feral goats in all states is likely to be higher than reported
as routine post mortem inspections have not included lymph nodes
of head and neck. Suggests future surveys include examination
of entire carcase.

<p>
 With prices for feral goats exceeding prices for sheep; goats
are no longer seen as vermin but as an important alternative income
source for pastoralists in semi-arid and arid areas of Western
Australia. This study examines the distribution and prevalence
of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) and considers the significance
of feral goats as a potential source of infection for sheep or
goats. Results showed that of 2920 feral goats slaughtered at
a Perth abattoir in 1984, 7.8% had lesions of CLA. Of the affected
goats, 49.3% had head, 46.7% body and 12.3% visceral lesions.
Results were compared with previously reported data from sheep
and significant differences are discussed. Head lesions were common
in goats but absent in sheep; lung lesions were less common in
goats than sheep; carcase lesions was similar in both species
while multiple lesions were less common in goats than in sheep.

 Author's summary:
<p>
  ""Caseous lymphadenitis was the most frequently encountered
pathological condition in 3,720 feral goats examined during routine
meat inspection procedures. Among nine separate consignments of
animals the prevalence of infection averaged 7.4% (range 0.3%-18.8%).
The majority of lesions were seen in lymph modes draining superficial
body areas although many also occurred in internal modes and organs.
Corynebacterium ovis was isolated from 25 of 32 lesions submitted
for bacteriological examination. Other conditions regularly encountered
included pneumonia, cysticercosis, sarcosporidiosis and lice infestation,
while myonecrosis, pleurisy, pericarditis, nephritis, hepatitis,
cirrhosis and mite infestation were only occasionally found. A
total of 171 serum samples were collected and tested against 17
antigens. Samples from 57.9% and 51.5% showed positive serological
reactions to the antigens for sarcosporidiosis and Q fever respectively.""

limited, and considers the use of the Angora to improve the performance
of feral goats. The present breeding policy of the Australian
mohair industry is directed towards increasing fleece weight and
body cover, and fibre diameter has increased. It is suggested
that more use should be made of fine and superfine fleeced Angoras

can be used to open up heavily scrub infested rangelands in the
Cobar region, and give a reasonable financial return on the investment
required in special fencing to confine them. The areas selected
were dominated by scrub species acceptable to goats: 2 species
in particular, narrow leaved hopbush (Dodonea [Dodonaea] attenuata)
and the juvenile form of mulga (Acacia aneura), occur at spacings
of 2-5 m, with mulga thickets often occupying large areas. These
areas occur widely in shrub invaded poplar box (Eucalyptus populnea)/Acacia
woodland across N. and W. New South Wales. Fencing and management
of feral goats to encourage the return of grass and herbage species,

  ""Fleece samples were taken from several body sites of 23
feral goats. The samples were dehaired, and measurements made
of down diameter and its distribution. These were compared with
measurements made on composite samples drawn from the total fleece
of each animal. Samples taken from the hip gave the most accurate
estimate of down diameter of fleeces of av. diameter, but midside
samples were better over the range of diameters exhibited by these
goats. None of the sites was very suitable for estimating the
diameter of extreme fibres, or the fibre diameter distribution.
The repeatabilities of the various measurements were generally
high. Production measurements recorded in 2yr from 20 of these
goats show that diameter, yield and weight of down had high repeatabilities,
but diameter distribution and length of down were not repeatable

 Author's abstract:
<p>
  ""The density of feral goats in about 234sqkm of arid rangeland
used for sheep grazing in South Australia was estimated by means
of a mark-resight technique. Marking and subsequent resighting
were done at watering points. The Petersen estimate was 4.4 goats
per square kilometre; adjustment to allow for non-random behaviour
raised this estimate to 5.0/sqkm. Maximum allowable sheep density
is 12/sqkm. The goat density we observed imposes an added burden
on the vegetation. The densities of red and western grey kangaroos,
when added together, approximate that of goats. Rabbits are virtually
absent. The long-term effects of the total grazing pressure on
the vegetation cannot be predicted in detail but will probably
be deleterious.""

We raise two different types of goats.
<ul>
<Li> <A HREF = ""DairyGoats.html"">Dairy Goats</A> are raised for goat milk.  They 
also
make good companions, go to petting zoos, and we show them at fairs.

<Li> <A HREF = ""Pygmy.html"">Pygmy Goats</A> are raised primarily for show.  Like 
dairy goats, they are good companions, and they go to shows, fairs, and petting zoos.  
</ul>

Female goats are called does. Male goats are called bucks. We primarily raise does because 
they are easier to manage, they don't have an offensive odor (unlike bucks), 
and there are more shows for does.  A male goat that has been neutered is known as a 
wether.  We usually don't keep dairy goat wethers, but some kids raise and show pygmy 
wethers.

Other domesticated goats include <A HREF = ""Boer.html"">Boer goats</A>
that are starting to be raised for meat, <a HREF =
""Cashmire.html"">Cashmere goats</a> that are raised for cashmere and <a
href=""Dwarf.html"">Nigerian Dwarf goats</a>.  Domesticated goats differ
from wild goats such as <a href=""MountainGoat.gif"">Mountain goats</a>.

<h3> Why raising goats is fun</h3>

Goats are fun because they all have different personalities and have
different little habits that can be amusing or interesting.  Goats are
very affectionate and especially during the summer, when they are too
hot to be active, they like to just hang around people and get a good
scratch.  Most goats' favorite scratchy spot is around their shoulder
but some even liked to be scratched in between their toes.  It is very
rewarding to see a goat you have raised from a baby grow up and have
kids and grandkids of her own.  With goats that doesn't have too take
too long, maybe about 3 or 4 years at most, because they are able to
breed when they are just a year old.  It's also neat to learn how to

<h3> A healthy goat </h3>
<ul><li>Eyes clear and bright.   Tearing or cloudy eyes probably mean a pinkeye infection.
<li>Coat smooth and shiny.   A dull coat could indicate parasites.  Fluffed up coat means 
the goat is not feeling well.
<li>Appetite good.   However, it is normal for a doe in labor to refuse to eat.
<li>Attitude alert.   Hunched back and droopy tail mean something is wrong.

</ul>


<HR><a name = ""care""> </a>
<h3> Basic care </h3>
Like any other animal, a goat can survive without food for several days, but not without 
water.  We provide automatic waterers in goat pens, and also leave a
bucket of water.  In some areas, of the country, its important to make sure the
water doesn't freeze, but we don't have that problem.<p>

Although many goat owners feel that a twice daily feeding is best, others feed only once a 
day and still have perfectly healthy goats.  You will have to decide what is practical for 
your animal and your schedule.   Try to keep both food and water where they cannot be 
soiled by the goat. <p>

The basic food we feed is alfalfa hay. An adult  dairy goat doe eats about  1/2 flake a day 
(about 5 pounds).  This is supplemented with a grain mixture that contains 14-16% protein
depending on the additional needs of the goat:
<ul>
<li> Dairy doe in milk: 2-3 pounds
<li> Pygmy doe in milk: 1-2 pounds
<li> Dry doe:  0-1 pounds
<li> Pregnant doe: (last 1-2 months) 1-2 pounds
<li> Wethers: Usually given no grain.
</ul>

We also provide either a loose mineral mix or a mineral brick. Since
alfalfa hay is high in calcium, we make sure the mineral mix is high
in phosphorous and low in calcium to maintain the proper
calcium-to-phosphorous ratio. <p>

Although this diet works for us, we suggest you consult with a local
goat breeder or veterinarian who is more familiar with the nutritional
needs of your goats and the nutritional value of the feed in your
area.

<HR><a name = ""prevention""> </a>
<h3> Preventative health care </h3>

In our area, there are three types of injections that the goats need
regularly: Tetanus toxiod, BoSe and a vacination for enterotoxemia.
We give 1/2 cc. of tetanus toxiod yearly (usually one month before a
doe is about to kid). BoSe contains selenium and vitamin E and is
necessary to maintain muscle tone in adults and prevent ""white muscle
disease"" in kids.  Because hay in our area is low in Selenium, our
goats receive 1 cc. of BoSe intramuscularly for every 40 pounds of
body weight twice a year.  The best time for bred does to receive BoSe
is about one month before they kid and then 5 months after they kid.
Babies should have their first injection at six weeks of age (1/2 cc),
unless they need it sooner to correct a problem. For enterotoxemia the
Clostridium Perfringens types C&D bacterin-toxoid vacination is given.
It is often combined with a tetanus toxiod in brand names such as
Bar-VAC CD/T or FERMACON CD/T. First course requires two doses at
21-28 days interval. The dose is 2ml SQ in the web of the elbow.
Until recently yearly boosters were the norm, but vets are just now
beginning to recommend twice yearly vaccinations.  When using the
combined CD/T it is not necessary to have a separate tetanus toxiod
vaccine.

<P><b> Check with a
local vet to make sure goats in your area need selenium, and that the
doses we use are appropriate for goats in your area and the brand of
injectible you use.  Overdoses of BoSe or injecting it to goats who
receive selenium as part of their diet may be fatal.  In your area,
additional vaccines for other diseases may be
necessary. </b> <p>

We deworm our goats twice yearly: in the fall before breeding and in
the spring immediately following kidding.  We use TBZ or paste wormers
intended for horses ivermectin (Zimectrin) or pyrantel tartrate
(Strongid C). <b>Caution: check the label or ask your veterinarian
whether the product can safely be given to a pregnant goat.  Check
labels for withdrawal time if you use the milk for human consumption.
</b>



<HR><a name = ""diseases""> </a>
<h3> Common  Diseases </h3>

<b>Coccidia</b> are tiny intestinal parasites, actually protozoans, that can
cause foamy, bloody diarrhea or a dull, dry coat.  Sometimes a goat
with coccidiosis (coccidia infestation) has an on-again-off-again soft
stool or no obvious symptoms at all.  You might not suspect a problem
until you notice that your kids are not growing as well as they
should.  Young kids up to four months of age are at highest risk and
should be treated at least once with the medication Albon.  Our
veterinarian recommends that they receive Albon for one week beginning
at about three or four weeks of age and again if they are very
stressed, such as when separated from their mother. If in doubt, take
a stool sample to a veterinarian who regularly treats goats.
<p>


 <b>Ketosis</b> (also known  as pregnancy toxemia) may occur in pregnant does late in their pregnancy. The
 doe  may be depressed,
 weak, uninterested in food, and have poor muscle control and balance.  
 If untreated, death follows within a few days. Early  in  the
 disease, many does will show a positive test for
 ketone bodies in the urine.  
 Ketosis may occur
 when the doe is carrying two or more kids, or when
 the doe is very fat.  This disease is caused by the
 sudden extra demand for energy by the fast-growing
 kids in the pregnant goat and the inability of the goat
 to eat enough  of her normal diet to provide  this energy
 (due to the kids taking up room in the body). The doe will  rapidly
 metabolize fat from her body stores produces ketones (a toxic
 by-product) and the symptoms of the disease. Treatment with propylene glycol at
 two to three ounces  twice a day will help.
 If the doe lies down and cannot stand, treatment is usually not successful
 unless she delivers at that time.   
 As a preventive measure,  do not let the doe
 get fat early in pregnancy and in the last month
 of pregnancy provide 1-2 pounds of grain in addition to hay. 
 <p>

    <b><a href=CAE.html>Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Syndrome</a> </b>(CAE)
is a viral disease.  In young kids  symptoms include
 a weakness in the rear legs, with no fever, or loss of appetite,  However,
  the unused  legs  lose  muscle  strength  and
 structure and the infected kids eventually die.
  In older goats, the same disease is seen as
 swollen joints, particularly the knees.   The disease develops slowly, and
 after 2 or more years, the animal has difficulty using
 its legs properly.   Infected goats have no fever,
 remain alert, and eat well.  However, they do not
 recover from the arthritis. 
 An inexpensive blood tests can be used to diagnose CAE.
 The disease is spread from older infected goats to kids, perhaps by
 contact or
 through the milk from an infected doe to her kid. There are no corrective
 procedures or treatments.  Isolating kids at birth and raising them on
 pasteurized goat milk is done to prevent the spread. It's a good idea
 to make sure a goat is CAE free before purchasing. However, the blood test
only checks for antibodies, and it's possible that an animal is infected and not
(yet) producing antibodies.
<p>
 <b>Mastitis</b>  is  an  inflammation  of  the mammary
 gland  (udder  or  milk-giving  gland)  of  animals,
 usually caused by bacteria. The symptoms
 of mastitis are heat,  pain,  and swelling of  the
 udder.  Usually you will notice some discoloration of
 the tissue and abnormal milk.   The infected udder
 will change in color from slightly more pink to a
 bright red, or to a black and cold udder. The milk from an
 infected udder will vary in color,  texture,  and
 thickness.   The California Mastitis Test (CMT) is  a good test for
 subclinical mastitis, but is not 100% accurate.  Laboratory culture or
 growth of the bacteria causing the mastitis is the best way to determine
 the exact diagnosis.  
 
 The causes of mastitis are most commonly rough treatment
 and unclean milking practices. Wash the goat's udder
 before milking, and dip (or spray) the teats after milking
 with a teat dip.  Wash your hands before milking each goat
 to prevent the spread.  The treatment  consists
 of an intramammary infusion of antibiotics, sometimes
 accompanied by additional antibiotics. Consulting a vet
 is important for this disease since there are many different bacteria
 that cause mastitis and different antibiotics are best for each.  If
untreated the infection spreads and the goat may die or lose the udder.
 

<HR><a name = ""Breeding""> </a>
<h3> Breeding</h3>

A dairy goat should weigh at least 80 pounds and be at least 8 months
old the first time she is bred.  A pygmy goat should be between 9 and
18 months and a good size for her age.  In order for the doe to
conceive (become pregnant), she must be in estrus (""heat"" or
""season"".)  Signs of estrus include flagging (wagging her tail),
mucous discharging from her rear, mounting other goats, and excited
behavior if she is near a buck.  At first, you'll probably breed your
does to a buck of a local breeder, but eventually, you might want to
consider <A HREF = ""AI.html"">owning your own buck or artificial
insemination</A>.  A good indication that a doe is pregnant is that
it does not come into heat on its next cycle, so check your goat
carefully three weeks after breeding. It may be hard to determine if a
dairy goat is pregnant if it was bred at the end of the breeding
season.


<HR><a name = ""labor""> </a> <h3> Labor</h3> 

The <a href=Birthdate.html>expected due date</a><img src=""new.gif""> is
150 days after breeding.  A few weeks before delivery, the goat's
udder will usually become enlarged.  A day or two before birth, the
udder often fills up and the pelvic ligaments at the base of the tail
relax so that the tail feels loose. Frequent urination and low pitched
bleating are also signs that labor will begin within a day or two.

The first sign we usually notice that indicates that labor is imminent
is the discharge of the mucous plug, followed by small amounts of
mucous.  In our experience, this usually occurs an hour or two before
birth.  <p> In the uterus, the kid is enclosed in an amniotic sac
which is surrounded by a water sac.  Usually the water sac bursts 30
minutes to 2 hours before the delivery of the first kid.  The amniotic
sac might burst a few minutes before delivery.  Usually, a kid will
be born front legs and head first, and no assistance is needed. In
multiple births, each kid is usually delivery 5-30 minutes after the
previous sibling, and the placenta is expelled a few hours later. <p>
<A HREF=""Birth.gif""><img src=""Birth.gif""></A>
<p>

If the kids haven't arrived within two hours after the water sac breaks,
or if the kid is not positioned properly, an experienced goat breeder
or a veterinarian might be required to assist in the delivery by
repositioning the kid or ""pulling"" the kid out.

<HR><a name = ""newborn""> </a>
<h3> Care of newborn goats </h3>

Usually, the doe will lick the kid, to remove mucous and to stimulate
its breathing. With a weak kid or inattentive mother, you might want
to make sure the kid is freed from the amniotic sac and the mouth and
nose are free of mucous.  It is not necessary to cut the umbilical
cord, but if there is excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord of
the kid, we tie it with dental floss.  Within an hour of birth, we dip
the umbilical cord in 7% iodine to prevent infections.<p>

Usually within a half hour, the kids will attempt to stand and nurse.
It is important that the kids nurse within the first few hours of
birth to receive colostrum which provides immunoglobulins.<p>

Before the kids reach ten days old, they are dehorned.  Before
dehorning, we administer tetanus antitoxin to provide temporary
protection against tetanus. Often at the time of dehorning male kids
are castrated (also known as wethered). At one month of age, we
usually give tetanus toxiod (repeated one month later for newborns)
and BoSe. The BoSe is repeated every six months and the tetanus toxiod
is repeated yearly.

We raise two different types of goats.
<ul>
<li> <a href=""DairyGoats.html"">Dairy Goats</a> are raised for goat milk.  They 
also
make good companions, go to petting zoos, and we show them at fairs.

<li> <a href=""Pygmy.html"">Pygmy Goats</a> are raised primarily for show.  Like 
dairy goats, they are good companions, and they go to shows, fairs, and petting zoos.  
</li></li></ul>

Female goats are called does. Male goats are called bucks. We primarily raise does because 
they are easier to manage, they don't have an offensive odor (unlike bucks), 
and there are more shows for does.  A male goat that has been neutered is known as a 
wether.  We usually don't keep dairy goat wethers, but some kids raise and show pygmy 
wethers.

Other domesticated goats include <a href=""Boer.html"">Boer goats</a>
that are starting to be raised for meat, <a href=""Cashmire.html"">Cashmere goats</a> that are raised for cashmere and <a href=""Dwarf.html"">Nigerian Dwarf goats</a>.  Domesticated goats differ
from wild goats such as <a href=""MountainGoat.gif"">Mountain goats</a>.

<h3> Why raising goats is fun</h3>

Goats are fun because they all have different personalities and have
different little habits that can be amusing or interesting.  Goats are
very affectionate and especially during the summer, when they are too
hot to be active, they like to just hang around people and get a good
scratch.  Most goats' favorite scratchy spot is around their shoulder
but some even liked to be scratched in between their toes.  It is very
rewarding to see a goat you have raised from a baby grow up and have
kids and grandkids of her own.  With goats that doesn't have too take
too long, maybe about 3 or 4 years at most, because they are able to
breed when they are just a year old.  It's also neat to learn how to
milk or trim hooves and other things that you wouldn't ordinarily be
able to do.

<hr/><a name=""Stats""> </a>
<h3> Goat Statistics </h3>
<ul>
<li> Body Temperature:  102.5° F-104° F 
<li> Pulse/heart rate:  60 to 80 beats per minute
<li> Respiration rate:  15 to 30 breaths per minute
<li> Puberty:  4 to 12 months
<li> Estrus (""heat"") cycle:  18 to 23 days
<li> Length of each ""heat"":  12 to 36 hours
<li> Gestation (length of pregnancy):   <a href=""Birthdate.html"">150 days</a><img src=""new.gif""/>
<li> Breeding season:   Pygmy goats may be bred any time of the year.  Dairy goats 
usually go into heat between August and January in the Northern Hemisphere.
<li> Weight: An adult pygmy goat weighs between 50 and 75 pounds. An adult dairy goat 
doe weighs between 125 and 200 pounds. An adult dairy goat buck weighs between 200 
and 300 pounds.
</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<hr/><a name=""healthy""> </a>
<h3> A healthy goat </h3>
<ul><li>Eyes clear and bright.   Tearing or cloudy eyes probably mean a pinkeye infection.
<li>Coat smooth and shiny.   A dull coat could indicate parasites.  Fluffed up coat means 
the goat is not feeling well.
<li>Appetite good.   However, it is normal for a doe in labor to refuse to eat.
<li>Attitude alert.   Hunched back and droopy tail mean something is wrong.

</li></li></li></li></ul>
<hr/><a name=""care""> </a>
<h3> Basic care </h3>
Like any other animal, a goat can survive without food for several days, but not without 
water.  We provide automatic waterers in goat pens, and also leave a
bucket of water.  In some areas, of the country, its important to make sure the
water doesn't freeze, but we don't have that problem.<p>

Although many goat owners feel that a twice daily feeding is best, others feed only once a 
day and still have perfectly healthy goats.  You will have to decide what is practical for 
your animal and your schedule.   Try to keep both food and water where they cannot be 
soiled by the goat. <p>

The basic food we feed is alfalfa hay. An adult  dairy goat doe eats about  1/2 flake a day 
(about 5 pounds).  This is supplemented with a grain mixture that contains 14-16% protein
depending on the additional needs of the goat:
<ul>
<li> Dairy doe in milk: 2-3 pounds
<li> Pygmy doe in milk: 1-2 pounds
<li> Dry doe:  0-1 pounds
<li> Pregnant doe: (last 1-2 months) 1-2 pounds
<li> Wethers: Usually given no grain.
</li></li></li></li></li></ul>

We also provide either a loose mineral mix or a mineral brick. Since
alfalfa hay is high in calcium, we make sure the mineral mix is high
in phosphorous and low in calcium to maintain the proper
calcium-to-phosphorous ratio. <p>

Although this diet works for us, we suggest you consult with a local
goat breeder or veterinarian who is more familiar with the nutritional
needs of your goats and the nutritional value of the feed in your
area.

<hr/><a name=""prevention""> </a>
<h3> Preventative health care </h3>

In our area, there are three types of injections that the goats need
regularly: Tetanus toxiod, BoSe and a vacination for enterotoxemia.
We give 1/2 cc. of tetanus toxiod yearly (usually one month before a
doe is about to kid). BoSe contains selenium and vitamin E and is
necessary to maintain muscle tone in adults and prevent ""white muscle
disease"" in kids.  Because hay in our area is low in Selenium, our
goats receive 1 cc. of BoSe intramuscularly for every 40 pounds of
body weight twice a year.  The best time for bred does to receive BoSe
is about one month before they kid and then 5 months after they kid.
Babies should have their first injection at six weeks of age (1/2 cc),
unless they need it sooner to correct a problem. For enterotoxemia the
Clostridium Perfringens types C&amp;D bacterin-toxoid vacination is given.
It is often combined with a tetanus toxiod in brand names such as
Bar-VAC CD/T or FERMACON CD/T. First course requires two doses at
21-28 days interval. The dose is 2ml SQ in the web of the elbow.
Until recently yearly boosters were the norm, but vets are just now
beginning to recommend twice yearly vaccinations.  When using the
combined CD/T it is not necessary to have a separate tetanus toxiod
vaccine.

<p><b> Check with a
local vet to make sure goats in your area need selenium, and that the
doses we use are appropriate for goats in your area and the brand of
injectible you use.  Overdoses of BoSe or injecting it to goats who
receive selenium as part of their diet may be fatal.  In your area,
additional vaccines for other diseases may be
necessary. </b> <p>

We deworm our goats twice yearly: in the fall before breeding and in
the spring immediately following kidding.  We use TBZ or paste wormers
intended for horses ivermectin (Zimectrin) or pyrantel tartrate
(Strongid C). <b>Caution: check the label or ask your veterinarian
whether the product can safely be given to a pregnant goat.  Check
labels for withdrawal time if you use the milk for human consumption.
</b>
<hr/><a name=""diseases""> </a>
<h3> Common  Diseases </h3>
<b>Coccidia</b> are tiny intestinal parasites, actually protozoans, that can
cause foamy, bloody diarrhea or a dull, dry coat.  Sometimes a goat
with coccidiosis (coccidia infestation) has an on-again-off-again soft
stool or no obvious symptoms at all.  You might not suspect a problem
until you notice that your kids are not growing as well as they
should.  Young kids up to four months of age are at highest risk and
should be treated at least once with the medication Albon.  Our
veterinarian recommends that they receive Albon for one week beginning
at about three or four weeks of age and again if they are very
stressed, such as when separated from their mother. If in doubt, take
a stool sample to a veterinarian who regularly treats goats.
<p>
<b>Ketosis</b> (also known  as pregnancy toxemia) may occur in pregnant does late in their pregnancy. The
 doe  may be depressed,
 weak, uninterested in food, and have poor muscle control and balance.  
 If untreated, death follows within a few days. Early  in  the
 disease, many does will show a positive test for
 ketone bodies in the urine.  
 Ketosis may occur
 when the doe is carrying two or more kids, or when
 the doe is very fat.  This disease is caused by the
 sudden extra demand for energy by the fast-growing
 kids in the pregnant goat and the inability of the goat
 to eat enough  of her normal diet to provide  this energy
 (due to the kids taking up room in the body). The doe will  rapidly
 metabolize fat from her body stores produces ketones (a toxic
 by-product) and the symptoms of the disease. Treatment with propylene glycol at
 two to three ounces  twice a day will help.
 If the doe lies down and cannot stand, treatment is usually not successful
 unless she delivers at that time.   
 As a preventive measure,  do not let the doe
 get fat early in pregnancy and in the last month
 of pregnancy provide 1-2 pounds of grain in addition to hay. 
 <p>
<b><a href=""CAE.html"">Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Syndrome</a> </b>(CAE)
is a viral disease.  In young kids  symptoms include
 a weakness in the rear legs, with no fever, or loss of appetite,  However,
  the unused  legs  lose  muscle  strength  and
 structure and the infected kids eventually die.
  In older goats, the same disease is seen as
 swollen joints, particularly the knees.   The disease develops slowly, and
 after 2 or more years, the animal has difficulty using
 its legs properly.   Infected goats have no fever,
 remain alert, and eat well.  However, they do not
 recover from the arthritis. 
 An inexpensive blood tests can be used to diagnose CAE.
 The disease is spread from older infected goats to kids, perhaps by
 contact or
 through the milk from an infected doe to her kid. There are no corrective
 procedures or treatments.  Isolating kids at birth and raising them on
 pasteurized goat milk is done to prevent the spread. It's a good idea
 to make sure a goat is CAE free before purchasing. However, the blood test
only checks for antibodies, and it's possible that an animal is infected and not
(yet) producing antibodies.
<p>
<b>Mastitis</b>  is  an  inflammation  of  the mammary
 gland  (udder  or  milk-giving  gland)  of  animals,
 usually caused by bacteria. The symptoms
 of mastitis are heat,  pain,  and swelling of  the
 udder.  Usually you will notice some discoloration of
 the tissue and abnormal milk.   The infected udder
 will change in color from slightly more pink to a
 bright red, or to a black and cold udder. The milk from an
 infected udder will vary in color,  texture,  and
 thickness.   The California Mastitis Test (CMT) is  a good test for
 subclinical mastitis, but is not 100% accurate.  Laboratory culture or
 growth of the bacteria causing the mastitis is the best way to determine
 the exact diagnosis.  
 
 The causes of mastitis are most commonly rough treatment
 and unclean milking practices. Wash the goat's udder
 before milking, and dip (or spray) the teats after milking
 with a teat dip.  Wash your hands before milking each goat
 to prevent the spread.  The treatment  consists
 of an intramammary infusion of antibiotics, sometimes
 accompanied by additional antibiotics. Consulting a vet
 is important for this disease since there are many different bacteria
 that cause mastitis and different antibiotics are best for each.  If
untreated the infection spreads and the goat may die or lose the udder.
 

<hr/><a name=""Breeding""> </a>
<h3> Breeding</h3>

A dairy goat should weigh at least 80 pounds and be at least 8 months
old the first time she is bred.  A pygmy goat should be between 9 and
18 months and a good size for her age.  In order for the doe to
conceive (become pregnant), she must be in estrus (""heat"" or
""season"".)  Signs of estrus include flagging (wagging her tail),
mucous discharging from her rear, mounting other goats, and excited
behavior if she is near a buck.  At first, you'll probably breed your
does to a buck of a local breeder, but eventually, you might want to
consider <a href=""AI.html"">owning your own buck or artificial
insemination</a>.  A good indication that a doe is pregnant is that
it does not come into heat on its next cycle, so check your goat
carefully three weeks after breeding. It may be hard to determine if a
dairy goat is pregnant if it was bred at the end of the breeding
season.

<hr/><a name=""labor""> </a> <h3> Labor</h3> 

The <a href=""Birthdate.html"">expected due date</a><img src=""new.gif""/> is
150 days after breeding.  A few weeks before delivery, the goat's
udder will usually become enlarged.  A day or two before birth, the
udder often fills up and the pelvic ligaments at the base of the tail
relax so that the tail feels loose. Frequent urination and low pitched
bleating are also signs that labor will begin within a day or two.

The first sign we usually notice that indicates that labor is imminent
is the discharge of the mucous plug, followed by small amounts of
mucous.  In our experience, this usually occurs an hour or two before
birth.  <p> In the uterus, the kid is enclosed in an amniotic sac
which is surrounded by a water sac.  Usually the water sac bursts 30
minutes to 2 hours before the delivery of the first kid.  The amniotic
sac might burst a few minutes before delivery.  Usually, a kid will
be born front legs and head first, and no assistance is needed. In
multiple births, each kid is usually delivery 5-30 minutes after the
previous sibling, and the placenta is expelled a few hours later. <p>
<a href=""Birth.gif""><img src=""Birth.gif""/></a>
<p>

If the kids haven't arrived within two hours after the water sac breaks,
or if the kid is not positioned properly, an experienced goat breeder
or a veterinarian might be required to assist in the delivery by
repositioning the kid or ""pulling"" the kid out.

<hr/><a name=""newborn""> </a>
<h3> Care of newborn goats </h3>

Usually, the doe will lick the kid, to remove mucous and to stimulate
its breathing. With a weak kid or inattentive mother, you might want
to make sure the kid is freed from the amniotic sac and the mouth and
nose are free of mucous.  It is not necessary to cut the umbilical
cord, but if there is excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord of
the kid, we tie it with dental floss.  Within an hour of birth, we dip
the umbilical cord in 7% iodine to prevent infections.<p>

Usually within a half hour, the kids will attempt to stand and nurse.
It is important that the kids nurse within the first few hours of
birth to receive colostrum which provides immunoglobulins.<p>

Before the kids reach ten days old, they are dehorned.  Before
dehorning, we administer tetanus antitoxin to provide temporary
protection against tetanus. Often at the time of dehorning male kids
are castrated (also known as wethered). At one month of age, we
usually give tetanus toxiod (repeated one month later for newborns)
and BoSe. The BoSe is repeated every six months and the tetanus toxiod
is repeated yearly.

BET runs a total estrogen hormone assay tests on urine 50 days post breeding.
The test is more reliable after 60-62 days than at 50 days. The cost is $12.00
per sample (Feb 1996) and it requires 2ml urine in a clean container.

<title>Animals I Have Known</title>

<body>
<H2>A pictorial tour of some of the animals <br>
(and people) in my life</h2>

These are the first scans of these images.  Soon, I'll be coming back to 
clean them up and make them a bit smaller so that all the poor people
like me who only have SLIP connections don't have to spend so long
waiting for the pictures come in.<p>

<IMG SRC=""gifs/animals/kodiak.gif""><br>
I know it's just a boring, cliche`, dog picture to the rest of you
but to my brother and I, this dog had so much character I had to
put him in.  Sadly, Kodiak is no longer with us.<p>

<IMG SRC=""gifs/animals/patches.gif""><br>
In this picture, we see my first dog, Patches, being very patient
with my younger brother, Jason.  Jason is the one on the right
and yes, that is a banana peel on the dog's head.<p>

<IMG SRC=""gifs/animals/goat.gif""><br>
This is a goat we met in Amsterdam.  No other goats to be found.
No other animals of any kind.  We weren't on a farm; in fact, we 
were just on our way to a tulip nursery.  Apparently, goats just
roam free on the outskirts of Amsterdam.  Who says travel isn't
broadening?<p>

<IMG SRC=""gifs/animals/lions.gif""><br> Of course every university
seems to have animals or statues of some sort that yell/roar/ring/etc.
when freshmen/virgins/coeds/etc.  walk by.  At 
<A HREF=""http://www.purdue.edu"">Purdue University</a>, these are the
lions that roar when virgins go by.  Of course, to alums the most
enduring symbol of the University was the old smokestack which was
torn down the year after I graduated.  I don't have any pictures of
the smokestack so the lions will have to do in its absence.<p>

<IMG SRC=""gifs/animals/sbc06.gif""><br>
I met this goose while I was working at <A HREF=""http://www.anl.gov"">
Argonne National Labs</a>.  Argonne is on a nature preserve and is
very picturesque.  Known more to the outside residents for its unique
herd of albino deer and to the interns for its <I>Evil and Agressive
Swans</i>, the only pictures I seem to have are of the geese.  Go
figure!<p>

<IMG SRC=""gifs/animals/sbc08.gif""><br>
People are some of my favorite animals.  The original of this photo
just might be my favorite out of all those I've ever taken.  I caught
these kids at a swim meet in Greenwood, IN.  I was coaching at the time
but during the break between the morning and afternoon sessions the 
pool was mostly deserted and I was able to take a few pics of these 
girls in natural, childlike play.<p>

It is characterized by physical, chemical, and usually bacteriological changes in the milk and by pathological changes in the udder. Early recognition and prompt treatment are important for limiting tissue damage and production losses. However, since treatment is often unrewarding, emphasis should be on mastitis control and prevention.

<h4>
3A. ESSAY: IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF TO GET TO KNOW YOU,
 THE APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION:
ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU
HAVE REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON.
</h4><p>

I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have
been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more
efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban
refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently.
Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.
<p>
I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot
bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute
Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love,
and an outlaw in Peru.
<p>
Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly
defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army
ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject
of numerous documantaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges
in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I
repair electrical appliances free of charge.
<p>
I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics
worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't
perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been
caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured
New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My
deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany
circles. Children trust me.
<p>
I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I
once read Paradice Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and
still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the
exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed
several covert operations for CIA. I sleep only once a week; when I do
sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I succesfully
negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The
laws of physics do not apply to me.
<p>
I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On
weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years
ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have
made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven.
I breed prizewinning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving
competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played
Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.

A blend of red varietal wines that is aged softly, producing a pleasant,

Welcome to the Cygnus Animal Preserve!  Cygnus animals, past, present,
and future are electronically represented here. <p>

<h2>Cats</h2>

<a href=""/staff/gif/pati.gif"">Pati</a> and her husband
Pete have two cats, <a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~pati/bogart.gif"">Bogart</a> 
and <a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~pati/frodo.gif"">Frodo</a>.  Bogart 
is the troublemaker of the two.

<p>
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs"">Stan</a> and Natalie have two cats,
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs/mackey.tiff"">Mackey</a>
and
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs/velcro.tiff"">Velcro</a>
.
Mackey's name derives from the Mac the Knife
(he was named by Natalie's daughter when she was young),
while Velcro is notable for his clinginess.
Eventually we'll add an illustration of this...
At 14 and 18 pounds, Mackey and Velcro are both lapfuls!

<p>
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn"">Dawn</a> has 3 happy
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/kitties.gif"">fur balls</a>
named Tiger, Slinky and Zipidie.  Tigers are wonderful things,
Slinky thinks she's a spring, and Zipidie isn't so zippy now 
that he's a whopping 18 pounds.<p>
.

<h2>Dogs</h2>

<a href=""http://www.base.com/gordoni/gordoni.html"">Gordon's</a>
roommate's dog, <a
href=""http://www.base.com/roque/roque.html"">Roque</a>, is in charge of
system security at <a href=""http://www.base.com/"">base.com</a>.
<p>
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/juno.jpg"">Juno</a>, the world's
most spastic canine, can leap tall fences in a single bound, 
chase cars with the grace of a penguin, 
shatter glass with a single bark,
and coat an entire arm with slobber in a single lick.
If anyone dared enter his 
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn"">master</a>
's territory, they'd be loved to death in seconds. <p>

<h2>Goats</h2>

<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~ian"">Ian</a>'s parents run a cashmere
goat farm.  Here is a picture of 
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~ian/lady.gif"">Lady</a>, a doe imported from
Australia, and two of her kids.  There are more goat pictures at the <a
href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~ian/black-locust-farm.html"">Black Locust
Farm</a> home page.<p>

<h2>Pigs</h2>

<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/piggio.gif"">Piggio</a> is
a very happy pink pot pellied pig. 
After a not terribly successful career as company mascot at 3DO,
he hopes to change his name to Pignus and become Cygnus' new garbage
disposal, in spite of the more popular notion that the job might be 
better served by a goat.
He's had some very interesting adventures and has his very own 
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/piggio.html"">web page</a>
to tell you all about it.<p>

<h2>Birds</h2>

Cygnus' animal preserve wouldn't be complete without a bird sanctuary,
and in fact, you'll find one in
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn"">Dawn</a>'s house.  
At last count, there were 7 feathered squawkers and 10 more cooking in the nest.
And well, you know what they say about big birds, ""they make big poos"".
Here are some of their pictures if you'd like to meet some of them:<p>

<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/cookie.gif"">Cookie</a>, the scary cookatoo,
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/happy.gif"">Happy</a>, the lonely cockatiel,
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/cirrus_n_tinsel.gif"">Cirrus and Tinsel</a>, are two parakeets with half a brain each,
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/yin.gif"">Yin</a>, the lovebird who hates everyone,
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/albinos.gif"">Casper and Snowwhite</a>, the albino cockatiels whose
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/eggs.gif"">eggs</a> won't hatch, and
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/phoenix.gif"">Phoenix</a>, the jeolous conure.<p>

<h2>Fish</h2>

<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs"">Stan</a> and Natalie also
have a number of koi and goldfish in their outdoor pond.  In the
summer, they like to come up to the surface and suck on your
fingers.
Perhaps someday we'll get a picture of the heron that has eaten several
of our fish.  We usually keep a net over the pond to prevent any more
such tragic events.<p>

<h2>Everything Else</h2>

<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/herman.gif"">Herman</a> lives in a
shell.
He's very quiet, doesn't eat much, and doesn't get around too much.
We often wonder if he's still alive.<p>

Welcome to the Cygnus Animal Preserve!  Cygnus animals, past, present,
and future are electronically represented here. <p>
<h2>Cats</h2>
<a href=""/staff/gif/pati.gif"">Pati</a> and her husband
Pete have two cats, <a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~pati/bogart.gif"">Bogart</a> 
and <a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~pati/frodo.gif"">Frodo</a>.  Bogart 
is the troublemaker of the two.

<p>
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs"">Stan</a> and Natalie have two cats,
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs/mackey.tiff"">Mackey</a>
and
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~shebs/velcro.tiff"">Velcro</a>
.
Mackey's name derives from the Mac the Knife
(he was named by Natalie's daughter when she was young),
while Velcro is notable for his clinginess.
Eventually we'll add an illustration of this...
At 14 and 18 pounds, Mackey and Velcro are both lapfuls!

<p>
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn"">Dawn</a> has 3 happy
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/kitties.gif"">fur balls</a>
named Tiger, Slinky and Zipidie.  Tigers are wonderful things,
Slinky thinks she's a spring, and Zipidie isn't so zippy now 
that he's a whopping 18 pounds.<p>
.

<h2>Dogs</h2>
<a href=""http://www.base.com/gordoni/gordoni.html"">Gordon's</a>
roommate's dog, <a href=""http://www.base.com/roque/roque.html"">Roque</a>, is in charge of
system security at <a href=""http://www.base.com/"">base.com</a>.
<p>
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn/gifs/juno.jpg"">Juno</a>, the world's
most spastic canine, can leap tall fences in a single bound, 
chase cars with the grace of a penguin, 
shatter glass with a single bark,
and coat an entire arm with slobber in a single lick.
If anyone dared enter his 
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~dawn"">master</a>
's territory, they'd be loved to death in seconds. <p>
<h2>Goats</h2>
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~ian"">Ian</a>'s parents run a cashmere
goat farm.  Here is a picture of 
<a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~ian/lady.gif"">Lady</a>, a doe imported from
Australia, and two of her kids.  There are more goat pictures at the <a href=""http://www.cygnus.com/~ian/black-locust-farm.html"">Black Locust

<img src=""arthur.gif"" align=""right""><h1>Arthur's Column</h1>
<h2><i>Of goats and men ...</i></h2>
<b><i>Week ending 20th August 1995.</i></b>
<hr>
Firstly, thank you to Gabriel for handling the gruelling task of writing this column for the past three weeks.  As you will have noticed, Gabriel is a talented writer who rose to this task with admirable liquidity.  His other work can be perused in <a href=""/thecol/default.htm"">The Column Nobody Reads...</a><p>

Which brings me to the theme of this week's column.  What, you may ask, have goats to do with merriment and London.  Well, the answer is lies in the former.  Last week I was fortunate to be in Liechtenstein for their annual holiday (held appropriately on the birthday of the local prince), and am now able to report on some of the antics that occured.<p>

Getting plastered appears to be the principal feature of the day (along with bands, a fair etc.), and yours truly rose to the occasion together with various friends who happened to be there.  What started out as an innocent few pints rapidly degenerated into a rather decent party.  It is on what happened under the cover of darkness, however, that your columnist must report.<p>

There is this field.  It has four goats.  Not large ones, rather the cute brown type that one stops to pat on one's morning run.  In fact, one had stopped and patted said goats that very morning.  Which lead to the statement sometime later that day ... <i>""Wonder what the goats will look like in London Mall T Shirts""</i> (we had a few).  Not thinking more about it the day drew to its predictable close and I retired to bed.  A little later some of the younger members of the crew appeared at the house.  <i>""Got to come and see the goats!""</i>. <p>

You guessed it.  Four cute brown goats dressed in T Shirts.  This is where the fun started.<P>

Sensing the farmer's imminent disapproval wifey instructed said crew members to remove said T Shirts.  An easy task, you would think, particularly for such experienced goat dressers as these.  What they hadn't counted on was the arrival of one very large non-cute billy goat who, leaping the electric fence with ease, took control of the paddock, T Shirts, crew members, goats and all.  By taking control you can infer ""asserted authority"".  Within seconds the team were scrabbling down 30 foot drops where even goats are smart enough not to tread.  Battered and bruised they repaired to the house, wondering whether the Billy could negotiate the complex Swiss locks on the front door.<p>

On more local issues I went to the <b><i>Anchor Bankside</i></b> today for a pint and lunch.  I have written about this pub before - singing its praises etc.  I now have to rescind everything.  There are lots of tables outside where you can sit and enjoy a great view of the Thames, obscured only by the back of a 4 foot banner proclaiming the pub's presence to the river.  Unfortunately the tables are dirty, and the area is not kept clean.  Inside, the queue for lunch at 14.00 was long and very slow.  After spending the obligatory 30 minutes waiting to be served by unenthusiastic bar staff the food is virging on the inedible.<p>

Its a real shame that a pub with such heritage, clearly on the tourist maps, has become such a poor example of a British pub.<p>

Speaking of pubs, on my pub-crawl towards home yesterday afternoon I had the opportunity to stop in at <b><i>Dogget's Coat and Badge</i></b> on the south side of the Thames just west of Blackfriar's bridge.  Not worthy of a visit, I shall grade it 1 in the <a href=""http://www.londonmall.co.uk/pubguide/hserver.exe?pubguide+serve=_main>Pub Guide</a>.  I also had occasion to visit <b><i>The Founders Arms</i></b> on the South bank just east of Blackfriars.  This is a reasonable pub, worthy of a 4.  It has a great view of the river, but is unfortunately very modern looking and rather boring architecturally.  Worth a pint just for the view though.<p>

Thats all for now...

His other work can be perused in <a href=""/thecol/default.htm"">The Column Nobody Reads...</a><p>

Which brings me to the theme of this week's column.  What, you may ask, have goats to do with merriment and London.  Well, the answer is lies in the former.  Last week I was fortunate to be in Liechtenstein for their annual holiday (held appropriately on the birthday of the local prince), and am now able to report on some of the antics that occured.<p>

Getting plastered appears to be the principal feature of the day (along with bands, a fair etc.), and yours truly rose to the occasion together with various friends who happened to be there.  What started out as an innocent few pints rapidly degenerated into a rather decent party.  It is on what happened under the cover of darkness, however, that your columnist must report.<p>

There is this field.  It has four goats.  Not large ones, rather the cute brown type that one stops to pat on one's morning run.  In fact, one had stopped and patted said goats that very morning.  Which lead to the statement sometime later that day ... <i>""Wonder what the goats will look like in London Mall T Shirts""</i> (we had a few).  Not thinking more about it the day drew to its predictable close and I retired to bed.  A little later some of the younger members of the crew appeared at the house.  <i>""Got to come and see the goats!""</i>. <p>

You guessed it.  Four cute brown goats dressed in T Shirts.  This is where the fun started.<p>

Sensing the farmer's imminent disapproval wifey instructed said crew members to remove said T Shirts.  An easy task, you would think, particularly for such experienced goat dressers as these.  What they hadn't counted on was the arrival of one very large non-cute billy goat who, leaping the electric fence with ease, took control of the paddock, T Shirts, crew members, goats and all.  By taking control you can infer ""asserted authority"".  Within seconds the team were scrabbling down 30 foot drops where even goats are smart enough not to tread.  Battered and bruised they repaired to the house, wondering whether the Billy could negotiate the complex Swiss locks on the front door.<p>

On more local issues I went to the <b><i>Anchor Bankside</i></b> today for a pint and lunch.  I have written about this pub before - singing its praises etc.  I now have to rescind everything.  There are lots of tables outside where you can sit and enjoy a great view of the Thames, obscured only by the back of a 4 foot banner proclaiming the pub's presence to the river.  Unfortunately the tables are dirty, and the area is not kept clean.  Inside, the queue for lunch at 14.00 was long and very slow.  After spending the obligatory 30 minutes waiting to be served by unenthusiastic bar staff the food is virging on the inedible.<p>

Its a real shame that a pub with such heritage, clearly on the tourist maps, has become such a poor example of a British pub.<p>

Speaking of pubs, on my pub-crawl towards home yesterday afternoon I had the opportunity to stop in at <b><i>Dogget's Coat and Badge</i></b> on the south side of the Thames just west of Blackfriar's bridge.  Not worthy of a visit, I shall grade it 1 in the <a goat2.htm""="""" href=""http://www.londonmall.co.uk/pubguide/hserver.exe?pubguide+serve=_main&gt;Pub Guide&lt;/a&gt;.  I also had occasion to visit &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Founders Arms&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on the South bank just east of Blackfriars.  This is a reasonable pub, worthy of a 4.  It has a great view of the river, but is unfortunately very modern looking and rather boring architecturally.  Worth a pint just for the view though.&lt;p&gt;

Thats all for now...

This ""Spanish goat"" was released from a truck into an enclosed area. A brave
hunter then cornered it and put a bullet in its flank and it died a
slow and agonizing death. A subsequent bullet to the brain to put it out
of its misery was avoided because it would have ruined the goat for
trophy purposes. A marvellous sporting event? Not!

If you've read this far you are no doubt a coffee person. As such, you are certainly aware of the coffee discovery legend. To review: A few hundred years ago some African goatherders saw their goats cavorting with unusual great enthusiasm. Investigating, the goatherders traced the behavior to the coffee cherries the goats were eating. From this they learned to make a new beverage called kaffe.
<P> This is a lame story. Africa has been inhabited for thousands of centuries and just twenty generations ago people discovered coffee? Because for the first time goats decided to eat coffee beans? It's hincky! There is strong evidence to suggest that coffee is a new arrival on planet earth. It was brought here to wake people up. Soon after coffee was ""discovered"" coffee houses sprang up in Europe and in no time there was revolution. Freedom was in the air. Or more to the point, in the cup. Experience the

 original wild coffees from Ethiopia. And you too will wake up.

<h2>Helpful Hints for<i>March</i></h2>
<ul>
<li>Turn lights off on March 1 if you want does to freshen in October.</li>
<li>Start giving kids finr quality hay. A grass-alfalfa mix is best.</li>
<li>Start kids on a good 18% protein kid starter grain which also contains a coccidistat</li>
<li>Provide kids with clean, fresh water at least twice daily.</li>
<li>Trim feet on the whole herd, including older kids.</li>
<li>When kids are four weeks old, consider using part good milk replacer for a portion of the milk.</li>
<li>Feed fresh does according to production, remembering that their nutrient demands are very high just before kidding and also at the peak of lactation.</li>

DATE INCLUDED: OCTOBER, 1993

              A SMALL-SCALE AGRICULTURE ALTERNATIVE

                          Angora Goats
             United States Department of Agriculture

     Angora goats may be the most efficient fiber producers on
Earth.  These makers of mohair came from and were named after
Ankara (Angora prior to 1930), the Turkish province where they have
thrived for centuries.  Turkey guarded these goats against
exportation until 1849 when seven does and two bucks were imported
into the United States.  Later, more were imported from Turkey and
South Africa, the two principal mohair producers in the 19th
century.

     But now the United States has become one of the two biggest
producers (along with South Africa) of mohair - the long, lustrous,
wavy hair that goes into fine garments.  The other primary fiber
from goats is cashmere.  (See ""A Small-Scale Agriculture
Alternative, Cashmere Goats,"" December 1992).  Never the twain
should meet!  To cross Angora with cashmere goats results in a
fiber called cashgora, with very limited uses and characteristics
of neither fine fiber.

     The two goat types differ in temperaments, too.  The Angoras
are pretty laid back and docile, while cashmere and/or Spanish meat
goats are often flighty and high strung.  (Incidentally, Angora
goats, which do produce mohair, do not produce Angora hair; only
rabbis can produce that.)

     Although Angora goats are somewhat delicate, they grow their
fleeces year-round.  This puts considerable strain on the animal
and probably contributes to their lack of hardiness.

     About 90 percent of the U.S. mohair clip originates in Texas,
but the goats are raised over wide areas of the United States. 
They adapt well to many conditions, but are particularly suited to
the arid Southwester States.  Central and southwestern Texas have
all the major mohair warehouses.

Shear Twice a Year

     Angora goats are sheared twice a year, before breeding and
before kidding.  The hair grows about 3/4 of an inch a month, and
adult hair should be 4-6 inches long at shearing.  Shearing most
often follows the method developed by the Mexicans, with the goats
lying down with legs tied.  Shearing should be done on a clean-
swept floor or sheet of plywood.

     Care should be give to keep mohair clean and free from
contaminants-weeds, grass seeds, or urine.  Buyers severely
discount unclean hair and hair showing second cuts.  Fleeces should
be bagged separately in 6-foot burlap bags.  Not acceptable are
polyethylene bags or poly twine.

     Each bag should show the grower's name marked with a
permanent-type felt-tip pen, be tagged, and contain only one fleece
type clearly marked: Kid, yearling, young adult, adult, buck and
stained with spring or fall clip.  Special problems, such as burns
or coarse, extra long, or short fleece, should also be listed on
the goat.  Buyers slit the bag's side when inspecting before
buying; sellers must present a uniform product.

     An adult goat usually will produce 8-16 pounds of mohair a
year.  Kid mohair should be 4 inches long, is finer, and may yield
3-5 pounds a year.  Mohair fiber diameter ranges from 20 to 40
microns.

     If kemp fiber (long, straight, hollow and brittle) shows up on
any goats, especially along the backbone and thighs, such ""kempy""
animals should be culled, as suggested by the U.S. Mohair Marketing
Board.  Kemp fiber breaks easily and does not readily accept dye.

     The U.S. Government has a direct-payment program for mohair
producers help maintain a viable industry.  The direct payment
through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) is based on the
difference between the national average market price and a support
price.  In one recent year, producers received an average of @2.475
for every dollar's worth of mohair marketed.  Details can be found
at ASCS offices in many counties.

Selecting Bucks

     Bucks should be chosen for body conformation and fine hair. 
Preferred are open-faced bucks not blinded by hair.  Bucks should
be left with does for 6 weeks.  Angora goats are seasonally in
estrus.  The normal breeding season is from late September into
December.

     The gestation period for goats is usually 150 days, but it can
vary several days each way.  Kids are usually dropped from late
February through April or early May.  Twins may account for 40
percent of births, with a much lower percentage being triplets.

Fiber Comes First

     Angora goats have high nutrient requirements and give
nutritional advantage to fiber growth at the expense of other
demands.  Meeting nutritional needs should be the producer's main
concern.  Range forage of browse and forbs, protein supplements,
grain and crop residues, and cereal crop pastures can help supply
needed nutrients for growth and reproduction.

     Goats, browsing animals, can be pastured with sheep and
cattle; each species prefers different plants.  Goats prefer brush,
tree leaves, and rough plants.  They can improve pasture, clear
reforestation areas, control leafy spurge and destroy multiflora
roses, red cedars, sand burs, knapweed, hound's tongue, Canadian
thistle, sagebrush, backbrush, giant ragweed, sunflowers, and many
other weeds.

     When growing plants are not available, Angora goats need
supplemental hay and perhaps grain.  While gaining at breeding
time, young does should weigh at least 55 pounds (sheared weight)
and mature does at least 75.  Does need extra feed before and after
breeding so fetuses can develop hair follicles.

     During pregnancy and lactation, does need almost 1/2 pound of
crude protein daily.  Supplement feeding must start as soon as does
begin to lose weight and condition.  Improved nutrition brings more
and better big growthy kids and heavier fleeces.  Poor nutrition is
the leading cause of abortion and poor mothering.  Young or
lighter-weight goats are most subject to abortion.  Stress from
disease, moving long distances, or cold wet weather also cause
abortions.

     Goats should be give adequate nutrition before and after
shearing.  Angora goats must be able to take shelter from wet and
cold; great death loss can occur without shelter for 4 to 6 weeks
after shearing.  Goats to not carry layers of body fat, unlike
sheep.

Kidding on the Range

     Due to lack of labor and facilities, large herds are usually
kidded on the range, while many smaller herds use a more intensive
confinement system.  For open-range kidding, small pastures with
shelter, centrally located watering and supplement feeding areas,
and bedding spots reduce numbers of lost kids.

     Angora does and kids should be undisturbed for several weeks,
since does may abandon their kids.  When goats are moved, pastures
should be rechecked for kids.

     An even more intensive kidding system uses buildings, small
individual stalls, heat lamps, and feeder space.  This ""system
kidding"" can be done earlier in the year but is much more labor
intensive and therefore more expensive.  But a larger kid crop can
be realized with good management.  Before kidding, does should be
outdoors except in cold or wet weather or at night; this helps keep
bedding cleaned and dry and encourages needed exercise.

     As does kid, they should be moved into stalls and kids' navels
treated with 7 percent iodine.  C and D antitoxin should be given. 
Cold kids will not try to suck and may need a heat lamp.  When
warm, they will usually suck by themselves but may need help to
begin.  Angora kids, very sensitive to cold, can die within a short
time if too chilled.  Immersion in warm water to speed restoration
of body temperature and then thorough drying may save severely
chilled kids.

     After identification with matching paint or ear tags, well fed
does and kids can be moved to group pens or holding areas.  Twins
and triplets should not be grouped with singles since stronger kids
often rob milk from usually smaller multiple-birth kids.  Groups
should contain kids of similar age.

Parasites Trouble Goats

     Among goats, major health problems are internal and external
parasites, coccidiosis (in kids before and after weaning), and
pneumonia.  A good health care program includes vaccination for
most diseases and should be established between a grower and a
veterinarian.

     Goats' hooves may need to be trimmed, depending upon walking
conditions.  Rocky ground may take care of that problem.

     Goats may need special 4-foot-high fencing to keep them in and
predators out.  Goats like to go under or through obstacles.  Five
wire electric fences, with three wires hot and two grounded, make
a good system.  Woven wire fences may be used with the addition of
a 12 inch ""outrigger"" electric wire about 12 inches above ground. 
Small-mesh fencing also may be used.

     Horns caught in the fence or the crotch of a tree become life-
threatening, not only from predators but also from other goats. 
While most goats are not aggressive toward humans, they are not
always kind to other goats and in seconds can do serious or lethal
damage with their horns.  A goat raiser may find horns useful-as
handles.  For safety, both for the handler and for other animals,
horns' sharp points may be clipped, using a bolt cutter or similar
device.

Ankara (Angora prior to 1930), the Turkish province where they have
thrived for centuries.  Turkey guarded these goats against
exportation until 1849 when seven does and two bucks were imported
into the United States.  Later, more were imported from Turkey and
South Africa, the two principal mohair producers in the 19th
century.

     But now the United States has become one of the two biggest
producers (along with South Africa) of mohair - the long, lustrous,
wavy hair that goes into fine garments.  The other primary fiber
from goats is cashmere.  (See ""A Small-Scale Agriculture
Alternative, Cashmere Goats,"" December 1992).  Never the twain
should meet!  To cross Angora with cashmere goats results in a
fiber called cashgora, with very limited uses and characteristics
of neither fine fiber.

     The two goat types differ in temperaments, too.  The Angoras
are pretty laid back and docile, while cashmere and/or Spanish meat
goats are often flighty and high strung.  (Incidentally, Angora
goats, which do produce mohair, do not produce Angora hair; only
rabbis can produce that.)

     Although Angora goats are somewhat delicate, they grow their
fleeces year-round.  This puts considerable strain on the animal
and probably contributes to their lack of hardiness.

     About 90 percent of the U.S. mohair clip originates in Texas,
but the goats are raised over wide areas of the United States. 
They adapt well to many conditions, but are particularly suited to
the arid Southwester States.  Central and southwestern Texas have
all the major mohair warehouses.

Shear Twice a Year

     Angora goats are sheared twice a year, before breeding and
before kidding.  The hair grows about 3/4 of an inch a month, and
adult hair should be 4-6 inches long at shearing.  Shearing most
often follows the method developed by the Mexicans, with the goats
lying down with legs tied.  Shearing should be done on a clean-
swept floor or sheet of plywood.

     Care should be give to keep mohair clean and free from
contaminants-weeds, grass seeds, or urine.  Buyers severely
discount unclean hair and hair showing second cuts.  Fleeces should
be bagged separately in 6-foot burlap bags.  Not acceptable are
polyethylene bags or poly twine.

     Each bag should show the grower's name marked with a
permanent-type felt-tip pen, be tagged, and contain only one fleece
type clearly marked: Kid, yearling, young adult, adult, buck and
stained with spring or fall clip.  Special problems, such as burns
or coarse, extra long, or short fleece, should also be listed on
the goat.  Buyers slit the bag's side when inspecting before
buying; sellers must present a uniform product.

     An adult goat usually will produce 8-16 pounds of mohair a
year.  Kid mohair should be 4 inches long, is finer, and may yield
3-5 pounds a year.  Mohair fiber diameter ranges from 20 to 40
microns.

     If kemp fiber (long, straight, hollow and brittle) shows up on
any goats, especially along the backbone and thighs, such ""kempy""
animals should be culled, as suggested by the U.S. Mohair Marketing
Board.  Kemp fiber breaks easily and does not readily accept dye.

     The U.S. Government has a direct-payment program for mohair
producers help maintain a viable industry.  The direct payment
through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) is based on the
difference between the national average market price and a support
price.  In one recent year, producers received an average of @2.475
for every dollar's worth of mohair marketed.  Details can be found
at ASCS offices in many counties.

Selecting Bucks

     Bucks should be chosen for body conformation and fine hair. 
Preferred are open-faced bucks not blinded by hair.  Bucks should
be left with does for 6 weeks.  Angora goats are seasonally in
estrus.  The normal breeding season is from late September into
December.

     The gestation period for goats is usually 150 days, but it can
vary several days each way.  Kids are usually dropped from late
February through April or early May.  Twins may account for 40
percent of births, with a much lower percentage being triplets.

Fiber Comes First

     Angora goats have high nutrient requirements and give
nutritional advantage to fiber growth at the expense of other
demands.  Meeting nutritional needs should be the producer's main
concern.  Range forage of browse and forbs, protein supplements,
grain and crop residues, and cereal crop pastures can help supply
needed nutrients for growth and reproduction.

     Goats, browsing animals, can be pastured with sheep and
cattle; each species prefers different plants.  Goats prefer brush,
tree leaves, and rough plants.  They can improve pasture, clear
reforestation areas, control leafy spurge and destroy multiflora
roses, red cedars, sand burs, knapweed, hound's tongue, Canadian
thistle, sagebrush, backbrush, giant ragweed, sunflowers, and many
other weeds.

     When growing plants are not available, Angora goats need
supplemental hay and perhaps grain.  While gaining at breeding
time, young does should weigh at least 55 pounds (sheared weight)
and mature does at least 75.  Does need extra feed before and after
breeding so fetuses can develop hair follicles.

     During pregnancy and lactation, does need almost 1/2 pound of
crude protein daily.  Supplement feeding must start as soon as does
begin to lose weight and condition.  Improved nutrition brings more
and better big growthy kids and heavier fleeces.  Poor nutrition is
the leading cause of abortion and poor mothering.  Young or
lighter-weight goats are most subject to abortion.  Stress from
disease, moving long distances, or cold wet weather also cause
abortions.

     Goats should be give adequate nutrition before and after
shearing.  Angora goats must be able to take shelter from wet and
cold; great death loss can occur without shelter for 4 to 6 weeks
after shearing.  Goats to not carry layers of body fat, unlike
sheep.

Kidding on the Range

     Due to lack of labor and facilities, large herds are usually
kidded on the range, while many smaller herds use a more intensive
confinement system.  For open-range kidding, small pastures with
shelter, centrally located watering and supplement feeding areas,
and bedding spots reduce numbers of lost kids.

     Angora does and kids should be undisturbed for several weeks,
since does may abandon their kids.  When goats are moved, pastures
should be rechecked for kids.

     An even more intensive kidding system uses buildings, small
individual stalls, heat lamps, and feeder space.  This ""system
kidding"" can be done earlier in the year but is much more labor
intensive and therefore more expensive.  But a larger kid crop can
be realized with good management.  Before kidding, does should be
outdoors except in cold or wet weather or at night; this helps keep
bedding cleaned and dry and encourages needed exercise.

     As does kid, they should be moved into stalls and kids' navels
treated with 7 percent iodine.  C and D antitoxin should be given. 
Cold kids will not try to suck and may need a heat lamp.  When
warm, they will usually suck by themselves but may need help to
begin.  Angora kids, very sensitive to cold, can die within a short
time if too chilled.  Immersion in warm water to speed restoration
of body temperature and then thorough drying may save severely
chilled kids.

     After identification with matching paint or ear tags, well fed
does and kids can be moved to group pens or holding areas.  Twins
and triplets should not be grouped with singles since stronger kids
often rob milk from usually smaller multiple-birth kids.  Groups
should contain kids of similar age.

Parasites Trouble Goats

     Among goats, major health problems are internal and external
parasites, coccidiosis (in kids before and after weaning), and
pneumonia.  A good health care program includes vaccination for
most diseases and should be established between a grower and a
veterinarian.

     Goats' hooves may need to be trimmed, depending upon walking
conditions.  Rocky ground may take care of that problem.

     Goats may need special 4-foot-high fencing to keep them in and
predators out.  Goats like to go under or through obstacles.  Five
wire electric fences, with three wires hot and two grounded, make
a good system.  Woven wire fences may be used with the addition of
a 12 inch ""outrigger"" electric wire about 12 inches above ground. 
Small-mesh fencing also may be used.

     Horns caught in the fence or the crotch of a tree become life-
threatening, not only from predators but also from other goats. 
While most goats are not aggressive toward humans, they are not
always kind to other goats and in seconds can do serious or lethal
damage with their horns.  A goat raiser may find horns useful-as
handles.  For safety, both for the handler and for other animals,
horns' sharp points may be clipped, using a bolt cutter or similar
device.

<H3>Why are Goats so Cool?</H3>
Oh, c'mon, just look at them.  They're amazing.  Not only are they cute, 
but what other animal are you going to find that both eats your garbage 
<b>and</b> can make its own milk?  Exactly.  Besides, goats are just cool 
by nature.  They make great sources of consolation in times of grief, 
plus there are many unconfirmed rumors that they also make good sex 
counselors too. <BR><BR><BR>
<H3>The Beard:  An Evolutionary Link</H3>
Truly, Darwin was on to something.  Think about it.  Goats have beards.  
People have beards.  Hmm...could it be we that we and goats have a closer 
family bond than we'd previously believed?  And if so, why, goats may be 
on par with monkeys, dolphins, and white mice in intelligence.  Why, this 
practically makes goats family to us!<BR><BR><BR>
<H3>Fear from the Masses</H3>
Yes, that's right, most people just can't handle the power that 
goats represent.  That's why our society is trying to put them down and 
repress the danger that goats hold for the weak-willed's stagnant and 
close-minded ways of life.  Goats offer us freedom--a new and enlightened 
way of life that will help us transcend the mundaneness of the everyday 
world and take us to the ultimate level of perfection that we possess within 
ourselves.  So don't be decieved by claims that goats are only good for 
milk and cheese or angora and cashmere.  Realize that those beliefs are 
only the last-chance efforts of a desperate group of people trying to 
pose as a stumbling block to the new order.  <b>Only by knowing the truth 
can you become free.</b><BR><BR><BR>

<H3>How Did I Become Hooked?</H3>
Well, I really don't know.  This hobby/interest/obssesion of mine has 
been going on for a few number of years now, but I can't quite pinpoint 
how it started.  Mostly I think I saw some goats at a fair and was struck 
by how cute they can be.  Plus, liking goats isn't quite the same as 
liking dolphins or puppies, so the attention/amusement factor I get from 
this is worth it.  Besides, the quest for finding goat &quotthings&quot 
isn't easy, so it makes for a fun time.  However, the love of goats is a  
double-edged sword which isn't always easy to wield.  One example was 
when I took my niece (who was 3 years old back then) to a petting zoo 
which had goats who were 
intent on mobbing her and eating her clothing.  I &quotrescued&quot 
her, and she's recovered quite nicely 
since then (thanks to many readings of &quotThe Three Billy Goats 
Gruff,&quot) 
but the whole incidence just shows that <b>goats have a dark side</b> 
that can be unleashed if their power isn't properly reckoned 
with.<BR><BR><BR>

<H3>My Goats</H3>
For those of you that care (and heck, I'm impressed if anyone's actually 
read this far!), I have my own collection of goats.  Ok, they're not real 
live goats, but I think terming them as merely inanimate is harsh, as 
these goats definitely have a personality and prescence all their own.  
Here they are, in the order I obtained them...
<ul>
<LI><b>Inspector Gadget's Goat</b>:  Yeah, I realize it's a pathetic 
name, but it's the closest he's got.  He's just a small, brown plastic 
goat and he has an equally small plastic Inspector Gadget figurine riding 
him, hence the name.
<LI><b>The Straw Goat</b>:  Another lack-luster name, but again, very 
descriptive.  The Straw Goat is a self-standing goat made out of straw 
who is no more than a foot high.  He was given to me by my friend 
Anjanette, who obtained him from a store in Florida that bears his name.
<LI><b>Kimball</b>:  Kimball is the &quotflag-goat&quot of my 
collection.  He's a small stuffed white goat (whose picture can be seen 
in various parts of my home page) who was given to me by my friend 
Stacy.  Kimball's been a constant companion and has even survived a trip 
to Hell (Michigan) and back.
<LI><b>Kelsey</b>:  Kelsey is a small porcelin ornament of a brown goat 
with a carrot in his mouth.  I got Kelsey for Christmas from John 
Wallace, who was my Secret-Santa at the time.  Right now, Kelsey is 
perched on my desk guarding my book collection.
<LI><b>Kalliope</b>:  Ok, there's some discrepency that Kalliope might 
actually be a llama, but we're not really sure.  She's a small (tiny, 
even) stuffed red goat with neat designs on her.  David got her for me in 
the Carribbean, which by the way, is a virtual haven for free-running goats.
<LI><b>Kassidy</b>:  Kassidy is practically Kimball's twin.  The only 
difference between them is the color of ribbon they wear around their necks 
and the shade of brown that their horns are.  Kassidy was a gift from 
John and Heidi, and she has seen me through many troubled times.
<LI><b>Gadriel</b>:  Gadriel is the newest addition.  He's a <b>very</b> 
big goat with gray fur and vivid blue eyes.  He was purchased at the Ann 
Arbor Street Art Fair for me by David, and due to Gadriel's size, hugging 
him is almost like hugging a real goat.  Of course, I've never actually 
hugged a real goat, and I'm guessing that hugging Gadriel is probably a 
more enjoyable experience.<BR><BR></ul>

<li><b>Gadriel</b>:  Gadriel is the newest addition.  He's a <b>very</b> 
big goat with gray fur and vivid blue eyes.  He was purchased at the Ann 
Arbor Street Art Fair for me by David, and due to Gadriel's size, hugging 
him is almost like hugging a real goat.  Of course, I've never actually 
hugged a real goat, and I'm guessing that hugging Gadriel is probably a 
more enjoyable experience.<br/><br/></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>

<center><h2>More Goat Sources...</h2></center>
Yes, they do actually exist, and here are the ones that I recommend:
<ul><li><a href=""http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pazzani/4H/Goats.html"">The Irvine 
Mesa Charros 4-H Club's Goat Page</a>--This is a great source for real 
goat info and facts, complete with tons of pictures, sounds, and diagrams.
<li>These are some really good goat pictures that I could never get to save 
for my page.  Check them out <a href=""http://www.mindspring.com/~zoonet/montgome/pictures/goat.jpg"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.mindspring.com/~zoonet/jackson/pictures/goat.jpg"">here.</a>

The solution to the puzzler ""It's about Time"" is that Tim leaves work at 
4:24 p.m.<P>

In the ""Seat Yourself"" puzzler, Brett and Rett are seated in row 14.<P>

In the oldie ""Crossing the River"" the solution is to:<br>
1) take the goat over and come back alone<BR>
2) take the wolf over and bring the goat back<BR>
3) take the cabbage over and come back alone<BR>
4) take the goat over<br>

<H1>Police Halt Sheep Load Bound for Shoreham</H1>
<hr>
From <i>The News</i>, Portsmouth, England, April 28, 1995.
<p>
<i>Protesters hail intervention near Brighton a victory.</i>
<hr>
Police stopped a lorry carrying live animal exports bound for Shoreham
Harbour today and ordered the driver not to try to reach the port.
<p>
It was the first lorry to be halted following the decision by Sussex Police
to limit police escorts for exporters.
<p>
As hundreds of protesters gathered at the port today, a lorry from

<h1>Police Halt Sheep Load Bound for Shoreham</h1>
<hr/>
From <i>The News</i>, Portsmouth, England, April 28, 1995.
<p>
<i>Protesters hail intervention near Brighton a victory.</i>
<hr/>
Police stopped a lorry carrying live animal exports bound for Shoreham
Harbour today and ordered the driver not to try to reach the port.
<p>
It was the first lorry to be halted following the decision by Sussex Police
to limit police escorts for exporters.
<p>
As hundreds of protesters gathered at the port today, a lorry from 
Cheltenham carrying sheep was halted six miles away near Brighton.
<p>
The shippers, International Traders Ferries, are believed to have sent the
lorry to test the resolve of the police.
<p>
ITF's director Bill Ford was with the lorry as it was pulled over by Chief
Inspector Kelly McCartney and the driver warned not to continue.
<p>
A video cameraman, believed to be with ITF, filmed the incident while a
Ministry of Agriculture vet inspected the 176 sheep and passed them fit.
<p>
A spokesman for the lorry owners, G G Gilder, of Cheltenham, Gloucs. said

<p>
He said in Cheltenham ""I will be extremely annoyed if one of my lorries

&gt; Which brings up an issue of how to stop crackers.
&gt; 
&gt; Robert Heinlein, in his book, ""Starship Troopers"" raises the issue of 
&gt; what to do to prevent insurrection.  ""If you make the wolves the 
&gt; guardians of the sheep, it will turn them into sheep dogs.""
&gt; 
&gt; When you've already got more priveleges than God, you don't have to try 
&gt; to break into the system in order to get them.  Once you have them, you 
&gt; generally then are of the mindset to want to keep them.

Now this is just silly.  If you think this would stop *ALL* hacking/cracking
whatever you are being deceived.  There are more reasons for hacking
than getting more priveledge than God.  People who break into systems
can often get more priveledge than you could possibly give them if
this is their goal.  Then there are people who hack just because hacking
is fun.  And what about those people who are already admins and 
yet still hack into other peoples machines?

&gt; Which brings up an issue of how to stop crackers.
&gt; 
&gt; Robert Heinlein, in his book, ""Starship Troopers"" raises the issue of 
&gt; what to do to prevent insurrection.  ""If you make the wolves the 
&gt; guardians of the sheep, it will turn them into sheep dogs.""
&gt; 
&gt; When you've already got more priveleges than God, you don't have to try 
&gt; to break into the system in order to get them.  Once you have them, you 
&gt; generally then are of the mindset to want to keep them.

Now this is just silly.  If you think this would stop *ALL* hacking/cracking
whatever you are being deceived.  There are more reasons for hacking
than getting more priveledge than God.  People who break into systems
can often get more priveledge than you could possibly give them if
this is their goal.  Then there are people who hack just because hacking
is fun.  And what about those people who are already admins and 
yet still hack into other peoples machines?

Sheep, common name for a collection of grazing mammals that may be either wild or domesticated;
the domesticated varieties are the most widely distributed kind of domestic animal, found in nearly
all countries. Wild species are found in some areas of the world: the bighorn in western North
America; Dall sheep in northern Canada and Alaska; the mouflon in Mediterranean countries; the
Asian mouflon in western Asia; the urial in Afghanistan and Pakistan; and the argali in eastern Asia.
Sheep were probably domesticated about 11,000 years ago in what is now northern Iraq, and they
are thought to have descended primarily from the mouflon, although recent evidence suggests that
species such as the Asian mouflon contributed to some of the modern breeds.

<a name=""intr""><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

There are around 44 million sheep in the UK national flock including about
50 pure breeds and 300 crossbreeds. Over 22 million are lambs under one year
of age whilst 17 million are breeding ewes. Most sheep are slaughtered as
lambs.
<P>
Whilst sheep appear to have been less affected by intensive farming
practices compared with other farm animals their rearing can still involve
considerable suffering and welfare problems.

<IMG ALT=""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"" SRC=""../Fx/hrgreen.gif"">

<a name=""shee""><H3>Sheep Production</H3></a>

Ewes are first mated in their first or second years. Ewes naturally come
into heat in autumn or winter and gestation period is about five months
meaning lambs are born in spring or summer when the weather is warmer and
grass is growing. However this can be altered by controlled breeding with
ewes being brought into heat by administering hormones. This means lambs can
be born throughout the year providing a constant supply to market.
<P>
Rams are usually from special breeding farms. A single ram will usually
serve 30 to 60 ewes. Artificial insemination is uncommon in sheep though new
techniques are being developed to make it more efficient.
<P>
Ewes generally lamb once per year though selective breeding has meant some
can lamb twice per year. Breeding has also encouraged ewes to have twins or
triplets rather than a single lamb. If a ewe has only a single lamb the
unborn lamb may grow too large to pass through the narrow birth canal, sheep
having been bred to be smaller. Many farmers may choose to cut the front
legs off the live lamb whilst still in the womb. This is called embryotomy
and is carried out to avoid having to pay a vet to perform a caesarean. The
practice is widespread and more than 50,000 lambs are believed to be killed
in this manner during the lambing season.
<P>
Around 4 million lambs die each year. Exposure, hypothermia, starvation and
disease account for most of these. Sometimes there may be too many lambs in
the flock (due to multiple births or the death of ewes.) These orphan lambs
may be auctioned at markets at only a few days old. These lambs are
especially prone to disease and mortality is high. 35,000 orphan lambs are
sent to market during the lambing season.
<P>
A trend towards intensification means lambs are weaned earlier, fed on milk
substitute and feed concentrates and housed indoors. Indoor housing has lead
to increasing disease problems including coccidiosis, watery mouth and sheep
lice.
<P>
Male lambs are castrated before three months old. The commonest method is by
the application of a tight rubber ring cutting off the blood supply.
Castration can occur without anaesthetic in lambs up to three months
provided the ring is applied within the first week of life. The Farm Animal
Welfare Council (FAWC) stated in 1992 that castration by means of a rubber
ring causes considerably greater pain than the alternative clamping method
which is sometimes used. Acute pain lasts for several hours following
application of the ring. Sometimes castration may be performed surgically
using a knife. Again, this can be carried out without anaesthetic or a vet
being present. Tail docking of lambs may also occur without anaesthetic.
<P>
Between 15-25% of ewes are culled each year because of lameness, poor health
or failing to lamb. These are replaced in the flock. Flock stocking
densities are steadily increasing. This is causing environmental problems in
upland areas as overgrazing by sheep leads to loss of vegetation and soil
erosion.
<P>
In common with other farm animals, sheep suffer from a wide range of
diseases. The commonest is foot-rot which often results in lameness.
Foot-rot is encouraged by a high stocking density in housing and pens.
Lameness can also be caused by other infectious diseases and is a major 
welfare problem in sheep.
<P>
Sheep scab and myiasis (blowfly strike) are distressing and potentially
fatal contagious diseases in sheep. These are prevented by sheep dipping.
Sheep dipping was made compulsory twice a year in 1985 but made
non-compulsory again in 1992. Sheep dips contain toxic organophosphates
which are believed to be responsible for a high incidence of severe illness
in farmers. The possible toxic effects of sheep dips on the sheep themselves
has not been studied.
<P>
Other diseases affecting sheep include mastitis, toxoplasmosis, liver fluke
and scrapie (related to BSE in cattle). Many sheep suffer from pneumonia and
hypothermia during the winter when exposed to harsh weather conditions. This
is a particular problem for sheep in upland areas. Around 40% of sheep in
the UK live in hard upland conditions where winter hand feeding is
restricted and shelter minimal.
<P>
Some sheep are housed indoors during the winter in enclosed sheds or barns.
These may be poorly lit with concrete or slatted floors.

<IMG ALT=""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"" SRC=""../Fx/hrgreen.gif"">

<a name=""tran""><H3>Transport & Slaughter</H3></a>

Sheep may be transported considerable distances to slaughter. Over 1.3
million sheep and lambs were exported live in 1992 and this figure is
predicted to increase to between 2.5 and 3.5 million in 1993. 82% of live
sheep are exported to France.
<P>
Sheep are crammed into lorries so tightly packed that they may be unable to
turn around or lie down. They may be exposed to extreme weather conditions.
Heatstroke, hypothermia and pneumonia are common. Journeys can last 24 hours
or more during which time the sheep are neither fed or watered. This is
extremely distressing for the animals and mortality is high.
<P>
In Britain, most sheep go to slaughter via markets rather than direct from
the farm. This can increase the stress animals experience as well as
increasing the incidence of injury. Over 19 million sheep were slaughtered
in the UK in 1992. Over 90% of these were lambs of varying ages.
<P>
Sheep are slaughtered by electrical stunning followed by neck-cutting.
Stunning may often be ineffective and sheep may regain consciousness during
bleeding-out or even before throat-slitting. Stunning by firing a captive
bolt into the animals head is regarded as a more effective method but is not
often used in British abattoirs due to being more costly.

<IMG ALT=""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"" SRC=""../Fx/hrgreen.gif"">

<a name=""mule""><H3>Mulesing and Tooth-Grinding</H3></a>

Mulesing and tooth-grinding of sheep is prohibited in the UK but is
widespread elsewhere, especially in Australia and New Zealand. Much of the
lamb consumed and wool used in Britain is imported from these countries.
<P>
Australia is the world's leading sheep producer and exporter with a national
flock of an estimated 135 million sheep. Mortality is high, at around 8
million sheep per year. Around 100 million sheep suffer from mulesing each
year. Mulesing involves the slicing away of folds of skin from beneath the
sheep's tail which forms a wool-free scar and so prevents blowfly strike
(blowflies laying their eggs in the damp wool and the larvae eating into the
flesh of the living sheep). This is carried out without anaesthetic and
causes severe and prolonged pain. Mulesing is carried out because it is seen
as being cheaper and easier than alternatives such as regular shearing of
wool.
<P>
Tooth-grinding of older sheep is also routine. Tooth-grinding is supposed to
reduce the number of ewes prematurely culled due to broken teeth. It
involves a rotary stone cutting machine to slice off the ewe's front teeth
through the pulp almost down to the gum. In the UK, tooth-grinding was
carried out by a less severe method involving shortening the front teeth
with less likelihood of cutting through sensitive tissue. However, this
practice is now illegal in the UK.

<IMG ALT=""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"" SRC=""../Fx/hrgreen.gif"">

<a name=""wool""><H3>Wool</H3></a>

Wool production in the UK tends to be a by-product of the meat industry, the
wool produced being of low quality. Wool accounts for 5-10% of the total
value of a ewe. Most British wool is used for coarse fabrics such as
carpets. Wool production in Britain was 72 million kg in 1992.
<P>
Sheep are first sheared at around 14 months old. Lambs of some breeds may be
clipped to provide lambswool. The entire fleece is sheared in one piece.
Sheep have been selectively bred to produce a thick fleece and need to be
sheared in early summer to prevent heatstroke. Wild sheep do not need to be
sheared.
<P>
Nearly one-third of British wool is from slaughtered sheep (mostly lambs).
This is called skin wool. Skins from lambs also provide high value leather.

Foot-rot is encouraged by a high stocking density in housing and pens.
Lameness can also be caused by other infectious diseases and is a major 
welfare problem in sheep.
<p>
Sheep scab and myiasis (blowfly strike) are distressing and potentially
fatal contagious diseases in sheep. These are prevented by sheep dipping.
Sheep dipping was made compulsory twice a year in 1985 but made
non-compulsory again in 1992. Sheep dips contain toxic organophosphates
which are believed to be responsible for a high incidence of severe illness
in farmers. The possible toxic effects of sheep dips on the sheep themselves
has not been studied.
<p>
Other diseases affecting sheep include mastitis, toxoplasmosis, liver fluke
and scrapie (related to BSE in cattle). Many sheep suffer from pneumonia and
hypothermia during the winter when exposed to harsh weather conditions. This
is a particular problem for sheep in upland areas. Around 40% of sheep in
the UK live in hard upland conditions where winter hand feeding is
restricted and shelter minimal.
<p>
Some sheep are housed indoors during the winter in enclosed sheds or barns.
These may be poorly lit with concrete or slatted floors.

<a name=""tran""><h3>Transport &amp; Slaughter</h3></a>

Sheep may be transported considerable distances to slaughter. Over 1.3
million sheep and lambs were exported live in 1992 and this figure is
predicted to increase to between 2.5 and 3.5 million in 1993. 82% of live
sheep are exported to France.
<p>
Sheep are crammed into lorries so tightly packed that they may be unable to
turn around or lie down. They may be exposed to extreme weather conditions.
Heatstroke, hypothermia and pneumonia are common. Journeys can last 24 hours
or more during which time the sheep are neither fed or watered. This is
extremely distressing for the animals and mortality is high.
<p>
In Britain, most sheep go to slaughter via markets rather than direct from
the farm. This can increase the stress animals experience as well as
increasing the incidence of injury. Over 19 million sheep were slaughtered
in the UK in 1992. Over 90% of these were lambs of varying ages.
<p>
Sheep are slaughtered by electrical stunning followed by neck-cutting.
Stunning may often be ineffective and sheep may regain consciousness during
bleeding-out or even before throat-slitting. Stunning by firing a captive
bolt into the animals head is regarded as a more effective method but is not
often used in British abattoirs due to being more costly.

<a name=""mule""><h3>Mulesing and Tooth-Grinding</h3></a>

Mulesing and tooth-grinding of sheep is prohibited in the UK but is
widespread elsewhere, especially in Australia and New Zealand. Much of the
lamb consumed and wool used in Britain is imported from these countries.
<p>
Australia is the world's leading sheep producer and exporter with a national
flock of an estimated 135 million sheep. Mortality is high, at around 8
million sheep per year. Around 100 million sheep suffer from mulesing each
year. Mulesing involves the slicing away of folds of skin from beneath the
sheep's tail which forms a wool-free scar and so prevents blowfly strike
(blowflies laying their eggs in the damp wool and the larvae eating into the
flesh of the living sheep). This is carried out without anaesthetic and
causes severe and prolonged pain. Mulesing is carried out because it is seen
as being cheaper and easier than alternatives such as regular shearing of
wool.
<p>
Tooth-grinding of older sheep is also routine. Tooth-grinding is supposed to
reduce the number of ewes prematurely culled due to broken teeth. It
involves a rotary stone cutting machine to slice off the ewe's front teeth
through the pulp almost down to the gum. In the UK, tooth-grinding was
carried out by a less severe method involving shortening the front teeth
with less likelihood of cutting through sensitive tissue. However, this
practice is now illegal in the UK.

<a name=""wool""><h3>Wool</h3></a>

Wool production in the UK tends to be a by-product of the meat industry, the
wool produced being of low quality. Wool accounts for 5-10% of the total
value of a ewe. Most British wool is used for coarse fabrics such as
carpets. Wool production in Britain was 72 million kg in 1992.
<p>
Sheep are first sheared at around 14 months old. Lambs of some breeds may be
clipped to provide lambswool. The entire fleece is sheared in one piece.
Sheep have been selectively bred to produce a thick fleece and need to be
sheared in early summer to prevent heatstroke. Wild sheep do not need to be
sheared.
<p>
Nearly one-third of British wool is from slaughtered sheep (mostly lambs).
This is called skin wool. Skins from lambs also provide high value leather.

Yeah, that's how we got Papa Doc Duvalier and the military dictatorships
of too many countries to name.

If you make the wolves into guardians of the sheep, you've made it even
easier for the wolves to prey on the sheep.

This is how I love you:
I wish for a shade I can pull
I feel so afraid of watching you grow up
This love hurts to much
And I try and build a wall
So I don't have to see you fall
And I pray
Go away from my thoughts!
Why do you keep coming back
Over Black Sheep Wall?

Oh, I'd love to hold you close
But I play it cool
And keep my thoughts in a jar
Marked ""dangerous""
And everyone says, ""Never fear -
All boys his age experiment with their lives""
But my eyes want to close you out
I'll close you out
Why do you keep coming back
Over Black Sheep Wall?

Brother Black Sheep, love is strong
There's a shepherd out in every storm
And he's not afraid of a little rain
Why am I?
Why do I keep building up
This Black Sheep Wall?
Oh, I love you so!
Do you really know how much
How deep?
Black Sheep
This is how I love you:
With closed eyes
With turned back
With distance

There is little evidence to show that people with experience breaking
into computer systems have any particular talent for protecting
them.  A few may have some specific insights, and a rare few may have
general background, but that is not the general case.

For instance, being able to guess someone's password doesn't mean
someone is able to design a cryptographic algorithm to protect
passwords; and being able to exploit a race condition doesn't mean one
knows how to write effective code without them.

It's also the case that sheepdogs that ever stray and kill a lamb must
themselves be put down.  Once they've been a sheep killer, there is no
way to ever trust them not to do it again -- the temptation might be
too much for them on another occasion.  Ask a shepherd.

<BODY>

Many people believe that shearing sheep helps animals who might otherwise be burdened with too much wool. But without human interference, sheep grow just enough wool to protect themselves from temperature extremes. The fleece provides effective insulation against both cold and heat. Until shears were invented in 1000 B.C., the only way to obtain wool was to ""pluck"" sheep during molting seasons. Breeding for continuous growth began after the advent of shears.(1) 

<h2>Death ""Down Under""</h2>

With an estimated 148 million sheep, Australia produces eighty percent of all wool used worldwide. Flocks usually consist of thousands of sheep, and individual attention to their needs is virtually impossible.
<p>
Just weeks after birth, lambs' ears are punched, their tails are chopped off, and males are castrated without anesthetic.  According to Australian Law Reform Chairman, M.D. Kirby, Australian sheep suffer over 50 million operations a year that would constitute cruelty if performed on dogs or cats.(8) Extremely high rates of mortality are considered ""normal"": 20-40 percent of lambs die at birth or before the age of eight weeks from cold or starvation; eight million mature sheep die every year from disease, lack of shelter, and neglect. One million of these die within 30 days of shearing.(6)
<p>
In Australia, the most commonly raised sheep are Merinos, specifically bred to have wrinkly skin (which means more wool per animal). This unnatural overload of wool causes animals to die of heat exhaustion during hot months, and the wrinkles also collect urine and moisture. Attracted to the moisture, flies lay eggs in the folds of skin, and the hatched maggots can literally eat sheep alive. To prevent ""flystrike,"" Australian ranchers perform a barbarous operation--""mulesing""--or carving huge strips of skin off the backs of unanesthetized lambs' legs. This is done to cause smooth, scarred skin that won't harbor fly eggs. Yet the bloody wounds often get flystrike before they heal; and despite the feeling by many that mulesing may kill more sheep than it saves, the mutilation continues.(10)   
<p>
Aging sheep are subjected to ""tooth-grinding,"" an unanesthetized procedure that sheep farmers claim reduces tooth loss and extends the sheep's productive life. A battery-operated grinder is used to wear down the teeth. Another method involves using the edge of a disc cutter to cut right through the teeth near the level of the gums. This terrifying and painful procedure exposes the sensitive pulp cavities inside and causes the teeth to bleed profusely.(9) 
<p>
Faced with such vast amounts of death and disease, the rational step would be to reduce the numbers of sheep so as to maintain the existing ones decently. Instead, sheep are forced to bear more lambs by the administration of drugs.  Malnourished ewes are taken into laboratories and placed in climate-controlled chambers to determine how much exposure they can withstand before they die.(7)
<p>
Like other ""commodities,"" animals can fall victim to fluctuations in the economy. In 1990, 10 million Australian sheep were shot and buried in mass graves when they became practically valueless due to a lingering drought and low wool prices.

<h2>Shear Torture</h2>

Sheep are sheared each spring, after lambing, just before they would naturally shed their winter coats. Timing is critical: shearing too late means loss of wool. In the rush, an estimated one million Australian sheep die every year of exposure after premature shearing. A closely shorn sheep is, in fact, more sensitive to cold than a naked man since a sheep's normal body temperature is about 102 degrees F, much higher than a human's.(2)
<p>
When shearing, speed is everything. Shearers are usually paid by volume, not by hour, which encourages working quickly and carelessly. Says one eyewitness: ""the shearing shed must be one of the worst places in the world for cruelty to animals. I have seen shearers punch sheep with their shears or fists until the sheep's noses bled. I have seen sheep with half their faces shorn off.""

<h2>Live Export</h2>

When the sheep age and are no longer effective wool producers, they are transported long distances to slaughterhouses in trucks and trains without food or water. Those who fall are trampled by other frightened animals. On arrival, the dead and dying are piled into heaps. Those with foot rot attempt to drag themselves on their knees.(11)
<p>
The ultimate cruelty is the live export of seven million sheep every year from Australia to the Middle East, which the Wool Council of Australia supports as ""an important component of the wool and sheep industry."" These sheep travel vast distances until they reach the feedlots where they are held before being loaded onto ships. Many sheep, ill or wounded from the journey, faced with intensive crowding, disease, and strange food, die in the holding pens. Eighteen percent of sheep die during the 3-6 week transport process; in just one Australian feedlot, 15,000 sheep died from cold in 1983.(12) 
<p>
The surviving sheep--7 million a year--are herded onto huge 14-tier-high ships resembling the old slave-trade ships. Up to 125,000 sheep are packed tightly into each ship, each allocated an area hardly bigger than themselves, so that not all can lie down at once, or reach the feed troughs. Mired in their own waste for three weeks or more, the sheep suffer from sea-sickness, temperature extremes, disease, and injuries. Younger animals or babies born en route are often trampled to death. Shipboard mortality ranges up to 10 percent, and for every sheep who dies, many others become ill and are injured.(13)
<p>
When the three-week trip to the Middle East is over, the surviving sheep are killed in ritual slaughter (Halal).  Since Moslem religious law does not require that the knife be sharpened between kills, sheep often have their throats sawed open with dull knives. According to one witness in the Sitra abbatoir in Bahrain, men would begin slaughtering as soon as a pen was full.  The sheep would ""wave their heads in obvious confusion, trying to stand up and call out as the blood gushed from their throats.""(14) Other sheep are loaded into the trunk of a car for later slaughtering at the buyer's home.

<h2>Wildlife ""Scapegoats""</h2>

Sheep aren't the only animals who suffer as a result of the wool industry. The Australian government permits the slaughter of approximately 5 million kangaroos a year because it views them as ""pests"" who eat grass ranchers want for their sheep and cows. Ninety percent of kangaroo killers are ""weekend"" hunters, killing by the most expedient methods available:  running kangaroos down in trucks, poisoning their water, beating them to death, even impaling them on stakes and meat hooks and skinning them alive. The standard kangaroo hunting technique, as recounted by Paul and Anne Erlich in their book <em>Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species</em>, is to ""spotlight"" them from cars at night. ""The kangaroos would freeze in the light and were shot with rifles. Some were killed immediately, but some hunters purposely just wounded them--sometimes leaving them to suffer for hours or days so that their meat would remain fresh until they could be collected."" According to Dr. Susan Lieberman of the Humane Society of the U.S., joeys, or young kangaroos ""are not considered to be worth the cost of a bullet...and are often killed by being thrown against a tree or car bumper or kicked in the head.""
<p>
In the U.S., coyotes, vilified for allegedly preying on sheep and other livestock, are poisoned, shot and burned alive by the hundreds of thousands every year by ranchers and the U.S. government.

<h2>There are Alternatives</h2>

There are alternatives to wool clothes and blankets that the many people who are allergic to wool already use, including cotton, cotton flannel, polyester fleece, and other man-made fibers. These wash easily, don't shrink, keep their bright colors, cost less, and don't contribute to cruelty.

<hr/>
<h2>Stop Stealing Sheep &amp; find out how type works</h2>
Frederic Goudy, the American type designer, once said,
<blockquote>
""Anyone who would letterspace lower case would steal sheep.""
</blockquote>
From this eccentric quote 
authors Spiekermann &amp; Ginger take you on a whirlwind tour through the 
world of type you'll never forget.
 <p>
We shepherd the Reviewer's comments for you.
<blockquote>
""A gentle little introduction to a field, publishing, which the computer 
has dropped a lot of unsuspecting souls in the last few years.  There are 
examples of typography -- much advice and many aphorisms.""<br/>

<H2><IMG SRC=""sheep.gif""> Black Sheep Writing Contest</H2>
Sponsored by the <A HREF=""cgs-home.htm"">Colorado Genealogical Society</A>.
<PRE> </PRE>
The Colorado Genealogical Society invites you to compete for its Black
Sheep Award for Writing Excellence. Our purpose is to provide an
opportunity for you to apply your writing and documenting skills to
""black sheep"" genealogical subject matter. We seek originality in
choice, treatment, and presentation of subject matter as well as the
achievement of excellence in writing and documentation.
<PRE> </PRE><BR>
Your choice of subject is important. Black Sheep is defined as ""a
person considered undesirable or disgraceful by his family or group.""
Your subject need not be related to your family. All subjects in your
paper must have died prior to 1930. Here are some examples of topics:
genealogy of the ownership of a bordello which made your
city/family/state notorious; a wild and woolly ancestor of yours, of a
friend, or of no one you know; an unusual past owner of the house you
live in; an introduction to a compilation of the infamous such as to
an index of markers in a ""boot hill cemetery"" or a jail (the
compilation need not be a part of the entry); a religious heretic, or
a devout Christian in a family of heretics.
<PRE> </PRE><BR>
Entries will be judged on such criteria as: originality in choice and
treatment of subject matter; writing style (technique and approach
in presenting subject); depth of research; evaluation of evidence;
quality of source material used to document evidence; and writing
mechanics (form, grammar, punctuation, spelling, documentation).
<PRE> </PRE><BR>
The Black Sheep Award for Writing Excellence will be presented for
overall superior quality in written presentation. In addition,
citations for excellence may be awarded for special recognition of
originality, writing style, documentation, or technique.</P>

continuity of production.  Each ewe can lamb 5 times in 3 years or 1.67 times a

Magee, Cornell Sheep Farm Manager, and the figure depicts the <a href=""http://128.253.135.85/webimages/star2s.gif"">STAR </a>as we use it.
