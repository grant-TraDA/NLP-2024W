— The smallest.
===
— Baroness... — interjected the president.
===
— How can I earn your grace, madam? — he asked, taking her by the hand. — Perhaps pity... No, not pity. It is a feeling just as unpleasant for the giver as it is for the receiver. I don't want pity... But just think about what I will do, not seeing you for so long? It's true that we see each other very rarely even today; you don’t even know how time drags for those who wait... But as long as you live in Warsaw, I tell myself: I will see her, the day after tomorrow... tomorrow... Besides, I can see you at any moment, if not you, then at least your father, Mikołaj, or even this house...
===
— Oh! Miss Katarzyna is quite a catch — said the hostess. — A nice eye (though it seems to me that it has a flaw on the left or the right?)... the figure is nothing special, although she must have one shoulder higher (but that adds to her charm). The little nose is not really to my taste, and the lips are a bit too big, but what a good girl she is!... If only she had a bit more sense... Well, but sense, Mr. Wokulski, comes to women only around the age of thirty... I myself, when I was the same age as Kaśka, was as silly as a canary...
===
— And with his proper talent, he graciously shed light on the issues — the lawyer concluded.
===
Wokulski smiled.
===
Two very elegantly dressed young men entered the salon, one of whom was distinguished by a thin neck and a rather noticeable bald spot, while the other had languid eyes and a subtle way of speaking. They walked in side by side, holding their hats at the same height. They bowed equally, sat down in the same manner, crossed their legs in the same way, after which Mr. Rydzewski began focusing on keeping his neck in a vertical position, while Mr. Pieczarkowski started talking without interruption.
===
Now Miss Izabela lowered her eyes, extremely embarrassed.
===
They said goodbye. Mr. Tomasz tenderly pressed Wokulski's arm.
===
— Is it about you? — Mr. Maleski asked boldly.
===
— Never mind what I'm talking about, but I've heard that Stach's shop sells to the Jews... Well, I won't go to serve them anymore.
===
— Let's sit down, Mr. Wokulski — said the prince. — It has happened excellently, because I have an important matter to discuss with you. Imagine, your projects have caused a great panic among our cotton manufacturers... Did I say cotton manufacturers correctly?... They maintain that you want to destroy our industry... Is the competition that you are creating really that threatening?...
===
— So this young man has beliefs?... — exclaimed Miss Izabela. — That's interesting!
===
— You see, ma'am: that nice lady stole that lady's doll...
===
Mrs. Wąsowska exploded with anger.
===
Wokulski took her by the hand.
===
— Even if not even as a wife! — replied Baroness von Ples with a smile, whose husband had been paralyzed for five years.
===
"Fly to the castle, because Mr. Wokulski might still be having fun there, so that misfortune doesn't befall him." And I also ran off immediately.
===
— And those equally boring friends of his — Miss Izabela interjected with a smile. — All three of them fell in love with me every evening, each proposing to me at times that wouldn't interfere with the others, and then all three would confide in each other about their sufferings. Those gentlemen do everything together.
===
— Yes.
===
Since the old woman with the great fire began to tell me how perfect a district chief her late husband was, I didn't quite hear what Mrs. Stawska was discussing with Wokulski. It must have been interesting, as they were speaking in low voices:
===
— No — replied Wokulski, throwing himself onto the wicker chair in front of the counter. And since he was ashamed to explain right away why he had come, he asked:
===
Wokulski knew people well and often compared himself to them. Yet wherever he was, he always saw himself as a little better than others. Whether as a subject who spent nights over a book, as a student who pursued knowledge through hardship, or as a soldier under the rain of bullets — he always had in his soul an idea that reached beyond a few years ahead. Others lived from day to day, for their stomachs or their pockets.
===
— Oh, she!... I know... It wasn't me who liked her — Rzecki sighed — I just thought she would be a good wife for Stach...
===
— Aleś also hit the Germans! I know, I know — he whispered in my ear. — Sit down — he added, pointing to a chair. — Kaziek! rush to Grossmutter... Mr. Rzecki has arrived...
===
— Is Mr. Molinari at home? — asked the Swiss man.
===
— Hello-hello! — says Szprot, twirling his finger in the air. It's easy for you to demand satisfaction because you are a Hungarian officer. To murder a man, or even two, or to let oneself be chopped up is bread with butter for you... But I, sir, am a commercial agent, I have a wife, children, and time-sensitive interests...
===
"My triumph was short-lived," she told herself. "Krzeszowski really is a good shot... If he kills the only man who is standing up for me today, then what? A duel is indeed a barbaric relic. Because Wokulski (taking him from the moral side) is worth more than Krzeszowski, and yet... he could perish!... The last man in whom my father placed his hope."
===
Embarrassed, Mr. Ignacy went down to the front hall, clutching an album under his arm and bowing to all the ladies he had the honor of passing by. This courtesy, uncommon among Warsaw residents, made an impression in the hall. People began to ask: who is this? and although the person was not recognized, it was quickly noticed that Mr. Ignacy's hat was from ten years ago, his tie from five, and his dark green frock coat and tight checkered trousers belonged to an even earlier era. He was widely taken for a foreigner; however, when he asked someone from the staff: which way to the chairs? laughter erupted.
===
She was troubled by other questions: whether to return the service to Countess Karolowa — and — where her father got the money? If he had it before, why did he allow himself to incur debts with Mikołaj?... And if he didn't have it, from what source does he draw it today?... If she returns the service and the silver to her aunt, she might lose the opportunity to dispose of them profitably, and if she sells them for five thousand, those mementos could indeed end up in the wrong hands, as the countess had written.
===
And what if I could find out who she is?... Perhaps I could help her. Why should the lofty promises of Christ not be fulfilled, even through skeptics like me, while the devout are occupied with something else?
===
"Yes! — he whispered — it is more pleasant to live with these gentlemen than with merchants. They are truly made of different clay"…
===
After overcoming the first disappointment, Miss Izabela realized that marriage had to be accepted as it is. She was already determined to get married, on the condition, however, that her future partner would appeal to her, have a beautiful last name, and appropriate wealth. Indeed, she encountered beautiful, wealthy, and titled individuals; unfortunately, however, none of them combined all three conditions, so—once again, several years went by.
===
Wokulski closed the book, slowly got up from the armchair, and, reaching for the hat that was on the counter, headed towards the door. He felt a lack of breath and as if his skull were being split apart.
===
— I prefer to respond rather than take walks with them. The last time we rode with Mrs. Wąsowska, I got off the horse six times in two hours, and I didn't have a moment's peace for five minutes. Let Mr. Wokulski try now.
===
My second observation concerned Maruszewicz, who lived almost opposite Mrs. Stawska. This man leads a very peculiar lifestyle, characterized by an extraordinary regularity. He regularly does not pay his rent. Regularly, every few weeks, a lot of junk is taken out from his apartment: some statues, mirrors, carpets, clocks... But what’s more interesting — he also regularly receives new mirrors, new carpets, new clocks, and statues...
===
When Wokulski entered his room and, tired, fell onto the sofa, the doctor began:
===
"No, well — he thought — whoever arrives must leave... It's quite natural..."
===
Each of these people, for a while, occupied the secret thoughts of Miss Izabela; she dedicated the quietest sighs to each of them, understanding that for various reasons, she could not love him—and each of them, through the influence of divinity, appeared in her form, in half-reality dreams. And from those visions, Miss Izabela's eyes took on a new expression—of some otherworldly contemplation. Sometimes they looked somewhere above people and beyond the world; and when her ash-colored hair on her forehead was arranged so strangely, as if blown by a mysterious gust, to the onlookers, it seemed that they were seeing an angel or a saint.
===
He takes the newspaper and hides it in his pocket, not finishing his mazagran, pays for it, and — gets up from the table. The waiter glances at him sideways, two guests, amusing themselves with thin canes, raise their legs even higher, and one of them impertinently observes him through a monocle.
===
Suddenly — a carriage passes him with a driver on the box, carrying two women. One completely unknown to him, the other...
===
— Mrs. Wąsowska won't allow it, because you'll overturn it! — shouted Miss Felicya, whose fate had destined her for Wokulski.
===
— At first, it was hard for me without a job, but later I got used to it and here I am.
===
Not all of me shall die...
===
— All those who do not respect you as you deserve.
===
"Her?... No. Where would she finally come from?"
===
— Maybe at least from October you will start paying?
===
— The cousin of the Krzeszowskis... — he thought. — He will receive a love letter from Miss Izabela... What a scoundrel!...
===
Once he said without reason.
===
— No, this weighs half a kilogram... But it is empty... — replied Wokulski.
===
— Where is she going? Where does she live?...
===
P. Ignacy firmly adjusted his binoculars and raised himself in his chair, as if wishing to overturn the new theory that opposed his views in one fell swoop; but the entrance of the second subject, with a beard, confused him.
===
While Starski was teasing the widow, and Miss Felicya was blushing, Wokulski looked at his fiancée. She noticed this, responded to him with a contemptuous glance, and suddenly shifted from boundless sadness to childish cheerfulness. She herself offered her hand to the baron for a new kiss, and even accidentally brushed against him with her foot. Her admirer was so moved that he turned pale and his lips turned blue.
===
In November, on the very day the house collapsed on Wspólna Street, Wokulski returned from Moscow. And again, I do not know what he was doing there, suffice it to say that he earned about 70 thousand rubles... Such profits are beyond my understanding, but I swear that the business Stach was involved in must have been honest!
===
— Poor boy! — she said, laughing... — He only got two thousand rubles a year from the president and ten thousand as a gift. I advise him to marry rich, but he prefers to go to Vienna, and from there surely to Monte Carlo... I told him to come with us. It will be more fun, won’t it?...
===
III.
===
Lady Izabela wiped her eyes and quickly left the ruins. Wokulski followed her out.
===
— I believe we can bypass the issue of the local factories. Now, the esteemed Mr. Wokulski, may he kindly explain to us, with his usual vigor, what positive benefits his project will bring...
===
Approaching closer, Wokulski realized that he was not the only one who had noticed the particular tenement; even dogs, more often here than on any other wall, left their visiting cards.
===
— What? Do you think, sir, that I am flattering you to get a few francs?... Tomorrow I will come to see you again and I will convince you how unfair and foolish you are at this very moment...
===
— Maybe I'll come right away... — said Wokulski, lowering his eyes.
===
— I really like it. You know... I will take it, because mine is already gone...
===
— Do you suppose, ma'am, that...
===
Mrs. Wąsowska bit her lip.
===
— Sir... Stanisław — the lawyer began. — Do you know what our aristocracy and its supplements are?... It's a couple of thousand people who drain the whole country, sink money abroad, bring back the worst vices from there, infect the middle classes, supposedly healthy, and — they themselves perish without rescue: economically, physiologically, and morally. — If they were forced to work, if they were crossed with other layers, maybe... there would be some benefit from it, because indeed they are more refined organizations than ours. Do you understand... to cross, but... not to throw away 30,000 rubles to support them. So, I assist you in the crossing, but not in the squandering of 30,000 rubles — no!...
===
— What do I think when I look at you, ma'am?
===
— Why did it have to happen?... — Rzecki erupted. — What, was he bankrupt, or maybe he didn't have a job?... A store like that, a partnership, is a piece of cake? Couldn't he marry a beautiful, decent woman...
===
— Why did she marry him, why did she even listen to his passionate outbursts of love?
===
Opposite us, perhaps a verst away, were two hills, and between them a road. I noticed that on its yellow background some white marks appeared, which soon formed into a white line, and then a white patch. At the same time, from the marsh lying a few hundred steps to our left, blue soldiers emerged, who soon formed into a blue column. At that moment, to our right, a cannon shot boomed and a gray cloud of smoke appeared above the white Austrian unit. A couple of minutes of pause and again a shot and once more a cloud above the Austrians. Half a minute—again a shot and again a cloud...
===
She didn’t answer anything, but deep inside she was bitterly blaming herself for not being able to love Wokulski, even if she wanted to. Her heart had already dried up; besides, she herself was not sure if she even had a heart... Indeed, she kept thinking about Wokulski during her shop duties or at home; she waited for his visits, and when he didn’t come, she felt irritated and sad. He often appeared in her dreams, but after all, that wasn't love; she was incapable of love. If she had to tell the truth, she had even stopped loving her husband. It seemed to her that the memory of the absent one was like a tree in autumn, shedding its leaves in great clumps, leaving only a black skeleton behind.
===
— Quick return...
===
— He was right, yes!... — interjected the count.
===
Meanwhile, the train was still moving slowly, often stopping at stations for a long time. The air turned cool, the stars in the east began to fade; Wokulski closed the window and lay down on the rocking couch.
===
— Such a woman! — said the doctor, waving his hand. — Instead of despising the rabble, who had abandoned her several times, she revels in their company. Everyone sees it, and what's worse — Wokulski sees it himself...
===
"No, but what to do if they are just waiting for the money?... Maybe it will even be too little?..."
===
— No, now say one Hail Mary... Just kneel down... Look over there...
===
— Just don’t let Mr. Zara come back, because it’s time to get dressed and the hairdresser will arrive.
===
— I am very grateful for your kind remembrance. And what about you, Countess?
===
Uuu... I see that my old lady has gotten all worked up, so to rein her in regarding the plague, I again mentioned the trial, to which that dear lady responded with a lengthy discourse about the shame pursuing her family, about the possible imprisonment of Mrs. Stawska, about the fact that the samovar has come unsealed...
===
— No need — replied Stach.
===
The young man was outraged.
===
— A trifle, almost nothing... About five to six thousand rubles...
===
Lady Isabella laughed.
===
— A slacker, bankrupt... like all of them — replied Szuman. — And a former competitor... — he added.
===
— Where is the watchman? — I ask, touching my hat with my hand.
===
— Donkeys!... — the captain laughed and urged his horse forward.
===
— We just needed you, madam — exclaimed the baron — to make Zasławek resemble paradise. For we already have a very pleasant companion and an excellent guest here...
===
From the base of the hill, to the south, stretching to the edge of the horizon, there lay a plain, and on it — as if a river of white smoke, several hundred steps wide, long — how should I know — maybe a mile long.
===
Wokulski again felt as if a veil was falling from his eyes, beyond which he could see a completely different world and another Miss Izabela... But at that very moment he felt such turmoil in his head, pain in his chest, and madness in his nerves that he ran to the hallway and from there to the street, fearing that he was losing his mind.
===
— In that case, I will withdraw.
===
Lady Isabelle suddenly stood up.
===
— Which extracted the store receipts...
===
— I bought them for this purpose.
===
Wokulski listened to him attentively until Pruszków. Beyond Pruszków, the tired and monotonous voice of Mr. Tomasz began to weary him. Instead, the conversation between Miss Izabela and Starski, conducted in English, became increasingly clearer to his ears. He even heard a few sentences that piqued his interest and asked himself whether he should warn them that he understood English.
===
— For a penny worth of bay leaves...
===
— Oh, Floro, don't comfort me, don't lie!... Didn't you hear at dinner that even those few rubles my father has right now were won in cards from...
===
— Ah, forgive me, lady baroness! — exclaimed the steward. — Seven splendid rooms, two kitchens like parlors, two storerooms... Why don’t you give someone three rooms; after all, there are two front entrances.
===
— Through these windows, sir — the grandmother said — (though the letters rarely align), Helunia has developed a curiosity for the alphabet, and even now she still enjoys herself the most if she can create some form from the illuminated windows. That's why I don't even lower the blinds in the evening...
===
— Where does this sudden change... in the project come from — I asked, feeling that this was not what I wanted to know.
===
In mid-September, Mr. Rzecki was visited by Ochocki, who had come here from Zasławek for a few days.
