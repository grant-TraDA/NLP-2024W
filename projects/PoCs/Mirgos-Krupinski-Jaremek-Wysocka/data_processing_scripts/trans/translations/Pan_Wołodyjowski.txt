— If it weren't for your fickleness, if it weren't for the desire to entice everyone you meet — she said bitterly — everything could have been different, but now only desperation remains for you. Your fault! Your great fault! There is no remedy anymore, there is no salvation for you, only shame, and pain, and crying…
===
At this moment, Nowowiejski appeared before the dragons.
===
Krzysia began to look at the sky, to ponder, and finally replied:
===
— Truth! Ha! Where is he?
===
— Do you agree? — asked Wołodyjowski.
===
The further conversation was interrupted by a footman who came to report that there was again a terrible commotion in the city, as people were gathering to see the General of Podolia, who had just arrived with a rather significant retinue and several dozen infantry.
===
The kettle took Mr. Zagłoba in its arms, who was genuinely touched and immediately ordered a small jug to be brought, saying:
===
Both charged at each other in the middle of the field. Mr. Muszalski wanted to showcase his great strength and capture Hamdi alive, so with a powerful upward slash of his sabre, he grapplingly engaged with him, one hand seizing him by the throat, the other gripping the blade of the sabre, and he pulled strongly towards himself. At that moment, his girth on the saddle broke, so the unmatched archer twisted with it and fell to the ground. As for the falling Hamdi, he struck him on the head with the grip of the sabre and stunned him on the spot. The spahis and mamluks shouted joyfully, who had already begun to fear for Hamdi; the Poles were very dismayed, after which the wrestlers leaped toward each other in dense groups, some to seize the archer, others to at least defend his body.
===
— As long as there is breath in my nostrils, as long as the last drop of blood in my breast — shouted Zagłoba with the strength of deep conviction — nothing of the sort! I would not want to live in such a dishonored nation that would make a traitor and Judas its king as a reward!
===
She also blushed terribly and, not knowing what to do, stood up from the chair. Everyone was a little embarrassed and there was a moment of silence.
===
— Basia should have a lesson, but what good will it do! If she sees the sword above my head, she will be stubborn!
===
But the trees were silent, indeed they seemed unfriendly to her and blocked her way with their roots. Basia stumbled repeatedly over the snow-dusted knots and outgrowths of those roots. After a while, it became unbearably heavy for her, so she took off her warm coat and remained in just her little jacket. Relieved in this way, she walked and walked even more hastily, sometimes stumbling, sometimes falling into the deeper snow. The shoes made of thin leather, lined with fur, without separate soles, excellent for sledding or horseback riding, did not sufficiently protect her feet from hits against stones and roots, and moreover, having been soaked multiple times during the crossings and kept in a state of moisture by the warmth of her now feverish legs, they could quickly wear out in the forest.
===
She jumped up the hill. The others remained in worry and fear. No one slept in the whole house. The thought that Ketling might already be dead filled their hearts with dread. Moreover, the night had become stuffy, dark; thunder began to rumble and roll across the sky, and then bright lightning tore through the darkness every few moments. At midnight, the first storm of this spring raged over the land. Even the servants were awakened.
===
And she began to weave on the cart, repeating with tears:
===
— The enemy is crossing, and Żwaniec is busy! — said the little knight.
===
— And with a clear conscience, and with a clear conscience! — replied Zagłoba. — Your sage says: "He scratches where it itches," and I don't itch at all, therefore I'm cheerful! Oh! to a hundred infidels! what do I see? I swear I've seen you in Polish before, in a gray cap and with a saber, and now you've turned into some kind of Englishman and you're walking on thin legs, like a crane?
===
— I promise and give my word! — replied Ketling.
===
Basia kissed both cheeks of Mr. Zagłoba at once, causing him to become quite emotional and he said:
===
Pan Zagłoba, with the obstinacy typical of old people, insisted on uniting Basia with the young knight.
===
* * *
===
He twitched his mustache and, not without a certain pride, added:
===
— But not this fantasy! God have mercy on him, for he resembles a lackey more than a prince of such noble blood. If only these were different times! But today, the first thing is regard for the good of the homeland. Skrzetuski will tell you the same. Whatever the hetman does, I will do as well, for I believe in his sincerity for the homeland, as in the gospel.
===
Half an hour later, Mr. Wołodyjowski led the dragoons and the noble volunteers into the field, who counted on showing off during the skirmishes. From the old castle, one could clearly see the cavalry numbering around two thousand, composed in part of spahis, but mainly from the Sultan's Egyptian guard. Among the latter served the mighty and generous mamluks from along the Nile. Their gleaming armor, brightly woven golden kefiyehs on their heads, white burnouses, and jewel-encrusted weapons made them the most splendid cavalry in the world. They were armed with dirks mounted on knee-like canes, very crooked sabers, and knives. Sitting on their horses, like the wind of the swift, they swept across the field resembling a rainbow cloud, howling and twisting their deadly spears between their fingers. The sight of them could not be quenched from the castle.
===
— There is a sharper point for me — he finally said — that perhaps your honor does not know what friendship has arisen between us recently. All the later wars in Prussia during the sieges of castles, wherever there were still Swedish garrisons, we conducted together. We went both to Ukraine and to Lord Lubomirski and again to Ukraine, already after the death of the Russian voivode, under Lord Marshal Sobieski. One saddle served us as a pillow, we ate from one dish; we were called Castor and Pollux. And only when he went to fetch the maiden Borzobohata in Samogitia did the moment of separation come; who would have thought that his best hopes would vanish so quickly, like an arrow in the air?
===
— Yes! — replied Krzysia — and I know I couldn't find a more honorable one in all of Poland!
===
— I'll be back in an hour — said Ketling.
===
They quickly turned towards the dragons and, jumping onto their mounts, slid sideways down the slope among the growing thickets below, where they found themselves among the seeds of Mr. Motowidło.
===
— Commander — he said — in the New Castle, there is not a living soul.
===
— No, quiet! There’s nothing to talk about! — replied Wołodyjowski. — Service is service! I gave the hetman my word that I would enlist, and whether sooner or later, it doesn’t matter…
===
— Are you really standing by me?
===
— Tell me, sir, what does all this mean?
===
— No, regret is regret, but there is no advice. That Ketling loves you, it’s no wonder! Who wouldn’t love you?! And that you loved him, that’s my fate, but there’s no reason to be surprised, because how can I compare to Ketling! In the field, let him say so himself, I’m not any worse; however, that’s something different!… God has adorned one, and taken away from another, but rewarded with contemplation. So it is with me; as soon as the wind swept through the road, and the first fury passed, my conscience immediately said: why will you punish them? why will you spill this friendly blood? They fell in love, that is God’s will. The oldest people say that against the heart and the command of the hetman, it’s all in vain. It is God’s will that they fell in love, but as they did not betray, that is their honesty… If only Ketling had known that you promised me, I might have shouted at him: “stop!” — but he didn’t know that either. What is he guilty of? — nothing! And what are you guilty of? — nothing! He wanted to leave, you wanted to go to God… My fate is to blame, no one else, because it is already clear that it’s God’s finger in this, that I remain in orphanhood… Well, I’ve overcome it! I’ve overcome it!
===
Epilog
===
Having said this, she looked back at the rogues, but they were fleeing in a pack. There was no resemblance to a one-on-one fight, but Basia was determined to offer proof before the entire army that she wasn’t running away blindly and in a frenzy.
===
— Can you explain to me what this brotherhood is? — said Basia. /
===
Considering all of this, the senior officers were very worried, and the happy outcome of the defense seemed less probable to them. Indeed, it was unlikely, not only because of the Turkish forces but also because of themselves. Mr. Wołodyjowski was an unmatched and renowned soldier, but he did not possess the majesty of greatness. Those who carry the sun within them can warm everyone immediately, while those who are flames, no matter how hot, only warm those closest to them. Such was the case with the little knight. He could neither pour his spirit into others nor his skill in fencing. Mr. Potocki, the chief commander, was not a warrior, and he also lacked faith in himself, in others, and in the Commonwealth. The bishop mainly relied on arrangements; his brother had a heavy hand, but his mind was no lighter. The relief was impossible because the hetman, Mr. Sobieski, although great, was at that time powerless. The king was likewise powerless, the entire Commonwealth was powerless.
===
— Because Daddy is in captivity — Zosia replied with a thin little voice.
===
With his hand involuntarily, he reached once, then twice for his mustache and set it like crochet hooks, with the ends coming up under his eyes. At the same time, he began to look around the area with great curiosity, as if he were seeing it for the first time.
===
Then Basia began to gently stroke her face with her small hand.
===
CHAPTER LV.
===
— As God is my witness, no! Give me your ear!
===
But he did not respond at all, and for some time they rode in silence; at that moment, Miss Jeziorkowska turned to the little knight again:
===
— And what should she love me for?
===
— Five years ago, in sixty-seven — replied Zosia in a thin voice, not lifting her long eyelashes from her eyes.
===
Mr. Michał was moved by this sight regarding his own fate; he had been holding back as much as he could, but at that moment the dam of sorrow broke and tears streamed down from his eyes.
===
And the other two tears, then, the third appeared on her berries.
===
Chapter VII • Chapter VIII • Chapter IX
===
— I will tell you this, so that no one can misunderstand. Here I have hope in God that our Michał will recover from this wound more easily than we initially thought.
===
The first, tentative threads of the web, clinging to the trees, swayed with a slight breeze, so gentle that it did not even rustle the leaves.
===
Mellechowicz shook the hand that was offered to him and bowed for the third time. From the corners, other officers moved towards him, saying:
===
— I have a comfortable mansion towards Mokotów, which I already built after the war.
===
* * *
===
Azya repeated his terrible scream faster and faster.
===
— Michał — he said — tell the truth, did you only speak of resistance to encourage yourself, or can you really endure in the castle?
===
— We will go to the blue sea, where the snow lies only on the mountains, and if we return to these lands one day, it will be at the head of the bands, like the sand by the sea, like the leaves in those countless forests — carrying sword and fire. You, Halim, son of Kurdłuk, will set out on your journey today. You will find Kryczyński and tell him to send his troop under Raszków from that side. And Adurowicz, Morawski, Aleksandrowicz, Grocholski, Tworkowski, and whoever is alive from Lipków and Czeremisów, let them also approach me with their troops. And the bands that are by Dorosz at the wintering grounds, let them be informed to suddenly create great unrest from the direction of Humania, so that the Lack people’s commands from Mohylów, Jampol, and Raszków come out and move into the distant steppe. Let there be no troops on this road that I will take; it will be then, when I leave Raszków, that only ashes and ruins will remain after me!
===
CHAPTER XIX.
===
— It's true that it hit him unexpectedly. Your ladyship, you are completely off the mark with your female reasoning.
===
— I believe, I believe! — Mr. Zagłoba replied hastily, prudently stepping back behind the small knight. I would go with you, but I’m being nibbled at by the pedogra on my legs.
===
— Be quiet, fly, I’m not talking to you! Krzysiu, I’m talking to you. Do you want Ketling as your husband?
===
Ladies and gentlemen, love your enemies, punish them as a father punishes, correct them as an older brother corrects, otherwise it will go worse for them, but it will go worse for you as well, it will go worse for the entire Commonwealth.
===
The enemy evidently noticed the approaching banner of the sub-marshal, for at that moment, groups of riders poured out from the thicket growing in the middle of the plain, as if someone had startled a herd of deer. With each moment, more of them emerged. Forming a chain, they initially moved at a slow pace along the edge of the thicket; the riders lay flat on their horses' necks so that from a distance one could easily believe it was the herd itself moving in a long line along the clump. They clearly did not yet have certainty whether that banner was heading towards them and had already spotted them, or if it was merely a detachment scouting the area. In the latter case, they could hope that the bushes would hide them from the approaching eyes.
===
— What do you think about this letter?
===
But he pressed her in his arms as if he wanted to strangle her… A short breath escaped from his lips, his eyes were clouded, finally he pulled her out of the stirrups, from the saddle, and took her before him, pressing her breasts to his and his bluish lips, opening hungrily like a fish's mouth, began to seek her lips.
===
— What a nice one! — repeated Mellechowicz, pale as a corpse.
===
Meanwhile, the noise was increasing more and more. The Armenian warehouses of expensive goods, built in the market belonging to that nationality, were on fire starting from the cathedral. There were great riches burning in gold, silver, carpets, skins, and precious materials. After a moment, here and there, tongues of flames began to appear above the houses.
===
Here is an example: four edges of the grove begin to converge quickly, merging into four walls and creating a Chreptiowska hall. Basia is in it and sees everything clearly. A great fire is burning in the chimney, and, as usual, officers are sitting on the benches; Mr. Zagłoba is teasing Mr. Snitka; Mr. Motowidło sits silently, staring into the flame, and when something sizzles in the fire, he speaks in his prolonged voice: “Purifying soul, what do you need?” Mr. Muszalski and Mr. Hromyka are playing dice with Michał. Basia approaches them and says, “Michałku, I’ll sit on the bench and cuddle a bit, because I feel uneasy." Michał immediately embraces her: “What’s wrong, kitty? Or maybe…” And he leans towards her ear and whispers something, and she replies, “Oh, how uneasy I feel!” What a bright and calm hall! how dear Michał is! — yet Basia feels so uneasy that it almost frightens her…
===
Pan Wołodyjowski did not oppose this, because Zagłoba persuaded him to comply. He finally realized that one day he would have to fulfill Basina's wishes anyway, so he preferred to do it right away, especially since the marauders were not in the habit of using bows and firearms.
===
— I stand before worthier ones — he said.
===
— I was there — he said — just after your departure; the place where you were hadn't even cooled down and I could have easily caught up with you, but I crossed over to the Multan shore in Uszyca to listen for news from the steppe. Some groups have already passed, and I am afraid that they will emerge in Pokucie and strike at unsuspecting people. Others are marching ahead of the Turkish army and will be here soon. There will be a siege, my dearest dove, there's no escaping it, but we will not yield, because here everyone defends not only their homeland but also their personal belongings.
===
— The governor of Bełż is in the ramparts! — he shouted with a breathless chest.
===
— For Sir Michał the knight, Sir Michał the brave, Sir Michał the soldier…
===
— They will not conquer the whole Commonwealth. How little power did Carolus Gustavus have; at that time there was war both with the Northerners and with the Cossacks and with Rakoczy and with the elector, and where are they now? We have already carried fire and sword to their domestic hearths…
===
Perhaps she also felt a slight dizziness. Wołodyjowski was surrounded by the fame of the first soldier of the Commonwealth. All knightly mouths repeat his name with reverence. His sister exalted his nobility to the heavens; he was cloaked in charm, misfortune, and in addition, the young lady living under the same roof had grown accustomed to his beauty.
===
The pan general raised his head.
===
— Krzysiek! — said Wołodyjowski — do you agree to tread upon human happiness as you do? Where are your words, where is our agreement? I cannot fight against God, but I will tell you what Mr. Zagłoba said to me yesterday, that a habit should not be sewn from human harm. You will not increase my harm with God's glory, for God reigns over the entire world; all nations belong to Him, His are the lands and seas and rivers and the birds of the air and the beasts of the forest and the sun and the stars; He has everything that you can think of and even more, and I only have you, my one beloved and dear, you are my happiness, you are my entire treasure. And can you presume that God needs to take away from a poor soldier, when He is such a rich man?… That He in His goodness would agree to this, that He would delight in it, would not be offended?… Look at what you give Him — yourself? But you are mine, because you promised me, so you are giving Him what is not yours; you are giving Him my weeping, my pain, perhaps my death. Do you have the right to do that? Consider this in your heart and mind, and in the end, ask your own conscience… For if I had offended you, if I had betrayed you in love, if I had forgotten you, if I had committed some sins and crimes — ha! I am not saying, I am not saying! But I went to the horde to listen, to approach the robbers, to serve my homeland with blood, health, and time, and I loved you, I thought of you for whole days and nights, and like a deer to water, like a bird to the air, like a child to a mother and like a parent to a child, so I longed for you!… And for all this, such a welcome, such a reward you have prepared for me?… Krzysiek, sweetest, my friend, my chosen love, tell me, where did this come from? Name your reasons to me as honestly, as openly as I present you my reasons and my rights; keep your faith with me, do not leave me alone with misfortune. You gave me the right, do not make me a banished one!…
===
— You're driving me crazy. You say that blessings might slip away? That's what I'm afraid of!
===
— Today I will declare!…
===
— But your grace — said Mr. Motowidło, addressing the small knight — the Inquisition has full authority over Mellechowicz, as he has never been a companion.
===
— And could you discern the people?
===
* * *
===
— Do you wish to enter, my lady? — asked Ketling, signaling the doorman to open the door.
===
— I know that to enter here, one must have a separate permission, but I have a letter from the archbishop, which I would like, dear brother, to give to the prior.
===
Pan Zagłoba was too well-known for his name to remain hidden for long. Besides, he didn't hide at all. As a result, the prince became even more furious, but he was also somewhat taken aback upon hearing that such a popular man, whom one must be afraid to confront, was standing in his way.

===
— I saw her death — said Charłamp — God forbid anyone less devout.
===
— I won’t tell her anything directly — he said to himself — but I must come up with some sort of consolation for her.
===
The archer departed. Slowly, the army followed behind him. Wołodyjowski mounted his horse and kept watch over the departure. The castle was emptying, but sluggishly, due to the obstructive rubble and debris.
===
— Good with modesty has always lived, therefore I do not feel any creaking in my bones! Where do you live, have you found an inn?
===
— I traveled to the end of the world for him, but… you know… if only you were healthy, I’m not saying… but you know! God forbid any fear, or any adventure… I would wither away from anxiety… A wife first, before the best friend… I feel sorry for Mr. Michał… but… you know.
===
— Give it a rest!
===
— Ketling! indulge yourself, indulge yourself, poor thing, as much as you want, for I only wanted to test you. Not Drohojowska, but the hajduk is intended for Michał.
===
— Is there great poverty?
===
Chapter XI • Chapter XII • Chapter XIII
===
— Get out! — said Zagłoba to her.
===
In this renewed battle, of the ancient knights of Chreptiów, apart from Lord Nowowiejski, two fell: Lord Motowidło and the fearsome archer, Lord Muszalski. Several bullets pierced Lord Motowidło's chest at once, and he fell like an oak that has reached its end. Eyewitnesses said that he fell at the hands of those Cossack brothers, who, under the command of Hohol, fought to the last against the mother and Christianity at the side of Hussein. As for Lord Muszalski — a strange thing! — he perished from a shot fired by some Turk during his flight. It pierced his throat entirely, just at the moment when, after the complete rout of the pagans, he reached for his sabre, wishing to unleash a few more sure death’s messengers after the fleeing. His soul must have joined with the soul of Dydiuk to secure the friendship forged on the Turkish galley with bonds of eternity. The former companions from Chreptiów found three bodies after the battle and mournfully bid them farewell with tears, although they envied such a glorious death. Lord Nowowiejski wore a smile on his lips and a quiet serenity on his face; Lord Motowidło seemed to sleep peacefully, while Lord Muszalski had his eyes raised upwards, as if he were praying. They were buried together, in that famous field of Chocim under the rock, on which, for the eternal memory of things, it was ordered to engrave their three names beneath a cross.
===
— That's how they all are. When it's service, it's service! My Michalisko won't even glance at me when military duty comes. And it's a good thing it’s not otherwise; because if you're going to love a soldier, it should be a good one.
===
— Let them try another twenty assaults, we are ready! — said others.
===
— Does that mean the stop happened a mile or a mile and a half from those thickets? — he said.
===
Soon, Ketling also started on a different topic.
===
— And do you remember how God returned you to me, when I said: I said this: “What kind of satisfaction can I promise You, Lord God? This is what I promise you. After the war, if I remain alive, I will establish a chapel, but in the time of war, I must achieve something significant, so that I do not feed You with ingratitude.” What about the castle! It's hardly enough for such a great benefit! The time has come! Is it fitting for the Savior to say to Himself: “Just a promise, a trinket?” Let the castle stones crush me first, I would rather have a knightly vow, given to God, to break! It must be, Baśka! — and that's the whole matter!… To God, Baśka, let us trust!…
