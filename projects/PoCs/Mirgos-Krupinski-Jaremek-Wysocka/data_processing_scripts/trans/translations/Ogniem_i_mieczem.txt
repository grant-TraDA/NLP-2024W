Pan Zagłoba fell silent and for a while they walked quietly beside each other. After some time, he began to speak again:
===
Silence had fallen, broken only by the snoring of Tuhaj-bej and the basket-maker — and in one corner of the cottage, a cricket chirped mournfully.
===
U46s

Once again, the sound of hoofbeats echoed, and this time several hundred riders, all Tatars, appeared in the marketplace. They were evidently fleeing blindly. The crowd blocked their way, and they threw themselves into the crowd, trampling it, hitting, scattering, hacking, pressing their horses toward the roadway leading to Cherkasy.
===
— According to the order! — replied Skrzetuski.
===
Anusia's cheeks burned even more fiercely; however, without a moment's hesitation, she replied:
===
— And you fly away, Laszek, from the cradle, when you see the step — replied the rider.
===
— Have you heard, Jan?
===
— The Czeremis plants corn under the rocks, plants wine, and catches birds in traps. With what you brought, she won't be lacking anything, except maybe for bird's milk. Don't worry, she won't come out of the gully, and no one will find out about her, as long as your people don't blab that she is here.
===
— Ergo? — thought Mr. Krzeczowski — ergo tomorrow I will land my seeds and Germans on the shore, and the following night, I will unexpectedly strike at the weakened by storms, I will cut down the Zaporizhzhia Cossacks, and I will throw Chmielnicki, bound at the hetman's feet. It's his own fault, because it could have turned out differently.
===
— Father! And when we go to Zolotonosha tomorrow, let's go to the commissioner's estate today!
===
— The most powerful khan of all the hordes, grandson of Muhammad, independent monarch, wise lord, happy lord, lord of the tree ordered from east to west, lord of the blooming tree...
===
— For the public good, dear standard-bearer.
===
* * *
===
— Please let me meet him, God! — said Mr. Skrzetuski.
===
— Who will take the governorship? A young ensign who has only just begun his duties from Konstantynów.
===
Pan Wołodyjowski could not see anything for a moment, as he had just come in from the light, but when his eyes had somewhat adjusted to the darkness, he noticed bodies lying motionless in the manure.
===
— And don't you need anything, your grace? Perhaps some honey for your pillow?
===
— To the wolves — said Mr. Zagłoba. — Last night we had horses, and they ate our horses, now they’ve come for us. I’m holding a pistol under my coat, but I don't know if it has enough powder for two shots, and I wouldn’t want to serve as marzipan at a wolf wedding. Do you hear, Miss — again!
===
— We are going, without staying — Mr. Skrzetuski replied.
===
— Who is approaching?
===
— On the wounds of Christ, what are you saying? Defeat?
===
Gradually, the fires began to fade and extinguish, the dull murmur of several hundred thousand voices gradually quieted; still here and there a voice of a pipe or the calls of Tatar horsemen could be heard, driving the horses out for their nightly forage — after which even those voices fell silent and sleep enveloped the countless Tatar and Cossack ranks.
===
— The warrior is old and experienced, a hetman, but he was too confident in himself and that is how he got lost. After all, he underestimated the entire rebellion and when I rushed to help him, he did not look at me eagerly at all. He did not want to share glory with anyone, fearing that they would attribute the victory to me...
===
"Sam buławoju, wszem polskim kraju, jak sam choczesz kierujesz."
===
Despite all the fear of Bohun, or perhaps because of it, he swore to himself that he would not be taken alive. He is free from chains, with a saber in hand — he will defend himself. They may dismember him, but they will not take him alive.
===
— Where am I?
===
— Traitors, infidels, dog-believers, Judases!...
===
— So the end of your suffering. Go, go, may God bless you. I would like to be at your wedding, as I should for Kurcewiczówna, being the daughter of Wasyla, and for you, as a friend, but in these times it is already impossible for me to move. When do you want to go?
===
— Surely you will find some trick? — said Kuszel.
===
— God grant that father Zaćwilichowski achieves something with our hetman, because if he doesn't succeed, we will go to the assault in the evening.
===
— If that's the case — thought Krzeczowski — then this is a lost man!
===
— Oh! I have already announced it to him — said Zagłoba — but if you gentlemen decide so, I will concede.
===
— Krzywonos with all his might.
===
— Is it absolutely necessary for you to go to the prince?
===

===
In a moment, three shepherds were brought in, wild, stupid, scared, who immediately confessed that they had indeed been ordered to set the forests on fire.
===
Skrzetuski bowed again.
===
— Every day we expect news from Crimea with the Tatars. It may already be here; to be truthful, it is unnecessary for you to go to Sich, as you will soon await their arrival here; and since they will not pass by Kudak, nor will they leave him behind, that is certain.
===
— Good night!
===
— And you haven't seen him?
===
— He lives, sir governor, but he wheezes; the noose has suffocated him.
===
— Two wolves have crossed the road! — Helena suddenly said.
===
— Yes, sir, I see no one, I am blind.
===
Mr. Wołodyjowski barely endured, so wounded was he in his sentiment for the fair sex. Zagłoba, on the other hand, burst out laughing and said:
===
— Hello, most illustrious voivode, the harvest is near, why do you not command your subjects to come out? Greetings, bright lord! We will already bore through that belly of yours.
===
— How was it? how? — asked the young ones.
===
The commissioners leaned and left. Doniec with the young men was indeed waiting in front of the station.
===
— That's how it must be. We are going in one direction, and he is going in the other, and now there is not even one, or two, between us, and in an hour there will be five. By the time he finds out about us on the way and turns back, we will be in Złoczów, not just in Zbaraż.
===
— You! down there. It's already too late for me! save yourself, Mr. Michal!
===
— No! we are in a group! — shouted Mr. Zagłoba. — Give him some beer!
===
— Oh, you don't understand, children, you don't understand. I was in Łubnie and saw the prince with my own eyes. He's terrifying! When he screams, the trees tremble in the forest, and when he stomps his foot, the ground shakes. Even the king fears him, and the hetmans obey him, and everyone is afraid of him. He has more troops than the khan and the sultan. You don't understand, children, you don't understand. You won't seek him out, but he will seek you. And you still don't know what I know, that all the Poles will come to his aid, and know this: where there are Poles, there are sabers!
===
— If I were to encounter Krzywonos himself, should he feel the urge to ride out for a surprise attack, I would give him pepper with ginger! Don't be afraid, gentlemen, I will teach these scoundrels to sing — yes, even to dance!
===
He learned along the way that the regimental commanders had gathered in Zbaraż and that they intended to defend themselves there — so that was where they were heading, rightly expecting that Prince Jeremi would come to the regimental commanders with his division, especially since a significant portion of his forces had already established their quarters in Zbaraż. Meanwhile, they reached as far as Płoskirov. The throng indeed thinned out on the highway, because already ten miles away the territory was occupied by the crown banners, so the Cossack bands did not dare to venture further, preferring to wait at a safe distance for Burłaj to arrive from one side and Chmielnicki from the other.
===
— Bohdan Chmielnicki, Ukrainian Hetman, requests a meeting with his friend, Colonel Krzeczowski.
===
— Half of you won't stay.

— Who's there? — echoed the half-awake wicker.
===
The knight fell to his knees for the second time and kissed the ground in prayer.
===
In Pan Zagłoba, courage unexpectedly struck his head, like wine. Perhaps it was desperation that gave him such haste to act; perhaps it was the hope that Mr. Wołodyjowski was still nearby, enough that he flashed his bare saber, his eyes rolled terrifyingly, and he shouted:
===
Meanwhile, others came, taking acquaintance with Mr. Skrzetuski and declaring their affection for him, for they generally disdained Czapliński and were pleased that he had encountered such a confusion. It is a strange and difficult thing to understand today that the entire nobility in the vicinity of Czehryn, as well as smaller landowners, leaseholders of the economy, and even those in the service of the Koniecpolskis, all knowing, as was customary in the neighborhood, about the disputes between Czapliński and Chmielnicki, sided with the latter. For Chmielnicki had the reputation of a distinguished soldier, who had made considerable contributions in various wars. It was also known that the king himself had dealings with him and highly valued his opinions, while the whole incident was viewed merely as a typical brawl between nobles, of which thousands were counted, especially in Ruthenian lands. Thus they sided with the one who could garner more favor, not foreseeing that such dreadful consequences would arise from it. Only later did hearts ignite with hatred towards Chmielnicki, both among the nobility and the clergy of both rites.
===
— You can go to both, you can go to one.
===
Lost ship.
===
It seemed that for this leader, you had nothing similar.
===
— And where will we go from here, Father Owsiwuj? — asked one voice.
===
"Stand, oh you, look up, which you have many[1],"
===
— And you know, you brutes — Mr. Zagłoba continued — what the Poles do to those who rebel? They hang such ones. And do you know how many troops Prince Jarema is leading, and do you know that he is no further than half a mile from here? And what's this, you dog souls? Bags in your bellows? How did you take us in here? Has your well dried up? Don’t you have water for your horses? And the mares! And the foals! I'll show you!
===
The head of Senna bowed down to the chest — and he fell asleep, dreaming of starosties, of castellanies, of royal grants and parliamentary awards...
===
— Also stock up on hay from the ceiling. Wipe the horses! We set off at dawn.
===
— The Hetman instructed me to tell you that he has arrived in Zbarazh and will visit you at the castle tomorrow.
===
Cutting the shackles off the legs was now the work of a moment.
===
— What is this?
===
— Jesus, Mary! — said Zagłoba to Skrzetuski. — I tell you, sir, that there’s a lion in me and I feel no fear, but I would prefer that their bright lightning locked them all up by tomorrow. As God is dear to me, there are too many of them. There probably won't be a bigger crowd even in the valley of Josaphat. And tell me, sir, what do these thieves want? Wouldn't every scoundrel be better off at home, quietly doing their corvée? What are we guilty of, that God made us gentry, and them peasants, and decreed they should be beneath us? Bah! Anger seizes me! I'm a sweet man, you can put me to the test, but don’t push me to my limits. They have had too much freedom, too much bread, and that's why they’ve multiplied like mice in a barn — and now they’re taking on cats. Just wait! just wait! There’s a cat here named Prince Jarema, and another one, Zagłoba! What do you think, will they try to negotiate treaties? If only they would humble themselves, perhaps we could spare them out of goodwill — eh? One thing constantly bothers me, is there enough vinegar in the camp? And to the devil with it! Look, gentlemen, there are fires again behind those fires — and more fires! May the black death fall upon such a congress!
===
Indeed, the ramparts of the Cossack camp stretched nearly a quarter of a mile, while the Polish camp appeared, in comparison, like a mere palisade. The discrepancy in strength was so great that the victory of the Cossacks could not be in doubt.
===
— Bij! morduj!
===
— It depends on the response of Chmielnicki, to whom Prince Czetwertyński went. Here is my lodging; please come in, Mr. Jan, I ordered some wine to be warmed, so we can refresh ourselves before sleep.
===
— It can't be! It can't be!
===
Chmielnicki's face brightened upon hearing these words, and the colonels, overwhelmingly in majority, began to call for a halt to the war and to send envoys to Warsaw, asking the lord from Brusiłów to come himself for the negotiations. Czarnota was still shouting and protesting, but the colonel fixed his threatening gaze on him and said:
===
A red ribbon of fire flew from one corner of the quadrilateral to the other — bullets whistled in the ears of the riders, here and there a man groaned, here and there a horse fell, the line of cavalry breaks, but they continue to charge; they are already approaching, the janissaries can hear the snorts and labored breaths of the horses — the quadrilateral closes in tighter and tilts the wall of spears, held in sinewy hands, towards the frenzied steeds. As many blades in this cloud, so many deaths threaten the knights.
===
Indeed, the air was heavy and humid, saturated with the fumes of corpses rotting for several days across the entire battlefield. The sky was covered with a low black veil of clouds. A storm hung over Zbaraż. Soldiers under their armor were drenched in sweat, and their chests breathed with effort.
===
— Have you lost your mind? Put your head in a bucket, I tell you! You already have blood on your hands, you've spilled it innocently. That unfortunate appendix is no longer breathing. The devil has possessed you — or you are the devil yourself, to the last. Come to your senses, or else the stick will get you, pagan son!
===
— Surely, it would be no different! — said the little Mr. Wołodyjowski.
===
— We need to get to Skrzetuski as soon as possible. We won't leave him either until the girl is found.
===
— Macie, father, a measure of liquor, and tell me what you have heard in the world. We know, too, that wanderers are everywhere and know everything. They have been with us, they ordered us that a black hour will come for you from Chmiel. Well, so we had a scythe and writings made for ourselves, so that we wouldn’t be the last, but now we don’t know whether to start already or to wait for the writings from Chmiel.
===
Zagłoba drew some comfort from the words of Mr. Michał, and then fell into deep thought.
===
— I will go to the chickpeas.
===
— For if the army were to retreat — which happens in the world — said Wołodyjowski — but here the commanders were the first to leave the camp, as if deliberately wanting to make it easier for the enemy to achieve victory and abandon the troops to slaughter.
===
The king delayed the assault, not wanting to spill blood, but seeing those enormous machines, he realized that there was no other option and ordered the trumpet to be sounded in the army, so they would prepare for the final confrontation by evening.
===
— Or are you in captivity? You here, lady. And where do you want to go back to? The Kurcewicz family has perished, fire has consumed the villages and towns, there is no prince in Łubnie, he is going against Khmelnytsky, and Khmelnytsky against him, everywhere there is war, blood is flowing, everywhere there are plenty of Cossacks and Tatars and soldiers. Who will respect you? Who will pity you, who will defend you, if not me?
===
— Here you go! Mr. Michał — said Zagłoba — didn't I tell you to protest?
===
— Let's go — said Helena, who suddenly felt invigorated.
===
— He remembered from the pain — whispered one.
===
— From this you witch, so that I would know.
===
— Oh my God! — he exclaimed — I haven't told you the most important thing. I heard that Bohun was killed.
===
— I poured it too much — said Mr. Longinus, handing back the flask.
===
Kurcewiczówna covered her eyes with her hands, and her pale, trembling lips repeated as if in a fever:
===
The unforgettable storm raged over the city, the castle, the trenches, and the camp. The battle was interrupted. Finally, the blue torrents opened up, and not streams, but torrents of rain began to pour down on the earth. The wave obscured the world; there was nothing visible a step ahead. Corpses floated in the moat. Cossack regiments, having abandoned the assault, fled one after another towards the camp, moving blindly, colliding with each other, and thinking that the enemy was pursuing them, scattered into the darkness; behind them, artillery, ammunition, and wagons were fleeing, sinking and overturning. The water tore apart Cossack entrenchments, roared in the ditches and trenches, forced its way under the earthen covers, although they were secured by ditches, and rushed noisily across the plain, as if chasing the fleeing Mołojcy.
===
— If you have already defiled her, may God condemn you, and may she at least find refuge in the convent...
===
— We will go on foot...
===
— We ran out of powder — we sent to the castle for more.
