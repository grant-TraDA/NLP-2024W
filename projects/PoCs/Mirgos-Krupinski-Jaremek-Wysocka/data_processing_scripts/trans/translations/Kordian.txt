Then he became heavy on her, lifeless and sagging,
===
I am the same one who once walked like a horse in a wheelbarrow,
===
GRZEGORZ
===
In the atmospheric greenhouse
===
She goes out after him.
===
No! That's not how it was...
===
KORDIAN
===
CAESAR
===
Don't tear it, it gave something; I have already gotten used to it.
===
The storm will not spread.
===
Where does the emperor sleep... are you curious,
===
But wealth in love is a fleeting dream,
===
Garden. – Lime avenues intersect in various directions – among the trees, one can see an abandoned house with broken windows... Autumn – the leaves are falling – windy... KORDIAN and LAURA dismount from their horses, leaving GRZEGORZ behind, and enter the avenue... They don’t say anything to each other for a long time.
===
Earth – it is a stain
===
CHORUS
===
It's nothing – it's nothing! That's what we need,
===
Maybe a cursed princess?
===
Come with me – we will look into the books and show the world,
===
The night of the Middle Ages has fallen, long and overcast,
===
The hour that no man
===
SATAN
===
And this payment is a silent, dark grave;
===
KORDIAN
===
I cast the martyr's ashes to the four winds!
===
And he says nothing – but when the executioner broke the sword,
===
Whether to throw a penny or a ball.
===
I plunged into unfortunate love, having soaked my whole heart in it...
===
In the name of God, with a dagger I write the word of revenge...
===
He will eat pheasants, and according to the law, he will be right.
===
I will remind you of the event...
===
I'll call him.
===
From Talleyrand's inkwell,
===
Where the king was passing by the road.
===
From the Babillońskiéj peoples' tower.
===
Do you not want this little grace? – I have granted you the throne!...
===
He enters the throne room.
===
The nurses for the royal children will quarrel,
===
SUB-LIEUTENANT
===
My name? And maybe it won't wither!...
===
Sit and listen! I know the end of the funny novel.
===
It grows on my window, in a knight's helmet,
===
They smoke.
===
Someone from the knights.
===
The decree lied well:
===
KORDIAN
===
GRAND DUKE
===
I throw my life at your feet... and I give it...
===
I don't feel like looking into the dirt of your heart;
===
Some word of magic.
===
If you, kings, were to rise from your coffins today,
===
It shows, through Punsza's mouth, tells,
===
At Twardowski's grave, he is reciting prayers.
===
But the kings fell in the shape of a felled poplar;
===
What is this? Kordian furrowed his brows, is he frowning, blushing?
===
Now among the black leaves, a circle hides darkly...
===
I will find a flower meadow and a secluded place among the forests.
===
FIRST OF THE PEOPLE
===
That's all – and nothing more... Now the tsar at the table,
===
Away with that sphinx that speaks riddles!
===
You will see how entire peoples lie prostrate before the cross;
===
It's cloth for us! For us! To tear it into pieces!...
===
Do you know what I want from you? – Michał doesn't understand.
===
Nothing is visible... The flag is fighting with the winds
===
I sacrificed you to death, now I fight with myself,
===
The devil mixed bile in the beggar,
===
And thinking.
===
It moves slowly...
===
Sky, sun, white moon,
===
KORDIAN
===
PRIEST
===
Pronounce: brother? – a short word... brother?
===
The outfit makes you seem like a holy person,
===
By the grace of God, we are healthy.
===
KORDIAN
===
I plunged into the abyss of conspiracies, dark shadows.
===
PRESIDENT
===
They woke up, looked into the abyss,
===
Let it jump! Listen! I want it to jump!
===
Lord! I cannot finish the prayer, what do You command?
===
I saw!
===
showing a head from the cauldron.
===
When streams of wine flow,
===
Like in a grave, it's silent...
===
Go away, Grzegorz!
===
I warn you, be in the choir of the Basilica on Sunday,
===
You stand among seven nations filled with gold,
===
Turn off the light and close your eyelids,
===
What is that scream?
===
So he kicked down the door, the iron reflects from the wardrobe,
===
The scent of cathedral incense.
===
WIOLETTA
===
Ha! It's coming...
===
Every day it must be lost, every day it must be sought...
===
It's nothing... I told him to nail the horseshoes weakly,
===
In the third, as Greek trees grew tribes;
===
They sat on their fathers' graves.
===
I felt what my father once felt, but I felt it longer.
===
To courtiers and the people;
===
"And is it good?"
===
Listen, I felt a wolfish hunger for your body,
