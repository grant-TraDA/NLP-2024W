— Take me with you...
===
— For the Savior's agony! — he began to speak in a quick voice. — I will stay here, and she should take my tesseræ, wrap her head in a rag, cover her shoulders with a cloak, and leave. Among the grave-digging slaves, there are a few underage lackeys, so the praetorians won’t recognize her, and once she gets to Petronius’ house, he will save her!
===
— Command, sir, to silence that old goat — he said — or allow me to bring my fist down on his head. Once in Buxentum, when Lucius Saturninus brought me to the games, I was set upon in an inn by seven drunken gladiators and none of them left with intact ribs. I’m not saying to abduct a virgin now, from among the crowd, because they might throw stones at our feet, but once she is at home, I will snatch her for you and take her wherever you wish.
===
Having gathered a bit of spirit, he asked:
===
— Whatever they do — he told himself — they will do it for me, though none of them suspect it... Gods, gods, just let me...
===
— Come with us to Cyprus. However, before that, remember that you need to see Caesar. It’s bad that you haven't been to see him yet; Tigellinus is ready to exploit this to your disadvantage. Although he has no personal hatred towards you, he cannot love you, especially because you are my nephew… We’ll say you were ill. We need to think about what you should answer him if he asks you about Lygia. It’s best to wave your hand and tell him that she was, until you got tired of her. He will understand that. Also, tell him that your illness kept you at home, that your fever was worsened by the sadness that you could not be in Naples and listen to his singing, and that only the hope of hearing him helped you recover. Don't be afraid to exaggerate. Tigellinus promises to come up with something not only great but also thick for Caesar... However, I fear he might undermine me. I am also afraid of your disposition…
===
He embraced her and pressed her to his chest for a while, with such fervor as if she had been wondrously rescued. Then, after releasing his arms, he took her temples in his hands, kissed her forehead, her eyes, and held her again, repeating her name, then he bent down to her knees and hands, greeted her, praised her, adored her. His joy had no bounds, just like his love and happiness.
===
He wanted to rise, but in the blink of an eye, fatal cords wrapped around him, tangling his arms and legs more tightly with every movement. Meanwhile, the prongs of the trident pinned him to the ground time and again. Once more he strained, supported himself on one arm, and straightened up to rise, but in vain! He raised his languid hand towards his head, unable to hold the sword any longer, and fell on his back. Kalendio pressed his teeth into the victim's neck against the ground, and, supporting himself with both hands on the prongs, turned towards the imperial box.
===
— Not only did I divert danger from Aulus Plautius and Pomponius, but also from both of us, and even from Lygia, whom they will not search for, if only because I persuaded that copper-bearded monkey to go to Antium, and from there to Neapolis or Baiae. And she will go, for in Rome he has not yet dared to appear publicly in the theater; I know, however, that for a long time he has been planning to perform in Neapolis. Then he dreams of Greece, where he wants to sing in all the major cities, and afterwards, with all the garlands that the "Graeculi" will offer him, he plans to make a triumphant entrance into Rome. During this time we will be able to search for Lygia freely and hide her safely. And what? Has our noble philosopher not been here yet?
===
— You came to my aid when I had already fallen. Thanks to you.
===
It was the truth. Seneca lacked that strength of soul that, for example, Cornutus or Thrasea possessed, so his life was a series of concessions, committed crimes. He felt it himself, he understood that a follower of the principles of Zeno of Citium should have gone a different way, and he suffered from it more than from the fear of death itself.
===
— Can I count on the loyalty of the soldiers?
===
— Have you seen her? — he finally asked.
===
— Petronius!
===
Could it be that Caesar himself rescued Lygeia?
===
— What is this? — he asked.
===
— Luna! — thought Vinicius.
===
He strained once more: for a moment, it seemed that he would tear his hand away from the cross and raise it threateningly over Caesar, but suddenly his gaunt arms elongated even more, his body sank downwards, his head fell onto his chest, and he died.
===
Silence fell. Suddenly, Caesar stood up, raised his hand high and began to declaim:
===
* * *
===
— Ah, Mark, could it be possible?...
===
↑ vestiplica – a female slave responsible for dressing and arranging the toga of her master.
===
— Glory to Christ! but do not wake her, sir.

CHAPTER XXXI.
===
The Act, having taken Lygię, began to question again:
===
Petronius began to examine the beautiful face of the boy more closely, his blue eyes and black, lush hair, after which he asked:
===
— There would be no reason to go to Achaea then.
===
— Yes — replied Vinicius.
===
Vinicius read and fell silent. Akte, on the other hand, seemed to read the thoughts in his gloomy face, for after a moment she said:
===
— Petronius?...
===
She finally left, full of inner concern and unease. Once, in prayer, she had offered Christ a cheerful and truly pure heart, like a tear. Now that cheerfulness was clouded. A venomous insect had entered the flower's interior and began to buzz within it. Even sleep, despite two sleepless nights, did not bring her solace. She dreamed that at the Ostrianum Nero, at the head of a procession of Augustinians, bacchanals, Corybants, and gladiators, a cart was trampling crowds of Christians crowned with roses, and Vinicius caught her in his arms, pulled her onto the chariot and, pressing her to his chest, whispered, "Come with us!"
===
* * *
===
— What's your name, brother? — asked the Greek.
===
— It's a new sect...
===
But Ursus, who was a naive man and who heard Vinicius saying that the Greek had been with him at the Ostrianum cemetery, and then saw them entering with Croton into the house where Lygia lived, stopped for a moment and said:
===
— Let's wait here; maybe someone will show up — Vinicius replied. — We don't need to be seen in the yard.
===
— Is this the hostage that Vinicius loves?
===
Having said this, he took out a letter from beneath the purple headboard and began to read as follows:
===
— But first, before you, he confessed his intention to me — and I, who know you and your love for Christ, explained to him that you are not the traitor, but that unknown person who wanted to persuade him to commit murder.
===
— Your mortal eyes have seen nothing, for the deity makes itself invisible to whomever it wishes. Know this: when I was in the temple of Vesta, she herself stood beside me and whispered in my ear, "Postpone your departure." It happened so unexpectedly that I was frightened, although for such visible care from the gods over me, I should be grateful to them.
===
— Eunice never leaves the cubiculum at night, where she sleeps with the old Akryzyona and Ifida; she never stays in the bath after your bath, sir... Other slaves laugh at her and call her Dyanna.
===
— If you want to know something about Lygia, then come with me. No! I won't say anything here! Come with me, I'll tell you my assumptions in the litter.
===
And he began to look curiously into Vinicius's face, and it was evident that Vinicius guessed what the peasant's gaze was asking him, for he replied.
===
— I love her alone in the world!
===
And Chilo replied:
===
So their astonishment was immense when they noticed that the curtain separated not an apartment from the courtyard, but another dark corridor, at the end of which a garden could be seen, composed of several cypress trees, a few myrtle bushes, and a small house, attached to the blind back wall of another tenement.
===
— Should I list everyone who had a little sense and therefore lived to be eighty or ninety years old despite the times of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero? Just take Domitius Afer as an example. He grew old peacefully, even though he was a thief and a rogue his entire life.
===
— And you wash up and rest. Your lips are blue and a shadow of you remains.
===
— The fire of Vesta has been desecrated because Rubria was with Caesar. But with you, she spoke...
===
— Unfortunately, these are such times — replied Aulus. — I am missing two teeth in the front, which were knocked out by a stone thrown by the hand of a Briton, and because of this, my speech has become whistling, yet I spent the happiest moments of my life in Britain...
===
And meanwhile, Peter began to speak in a voice so quiet at first that it could barely be heard:
===
He embraced her, but Akte began to defend her, and she herself defended herself with the last of her strength, for she felt that she was perishing. Yet, she vainly tried to remove his limp arm from her with both hands; in vain did she plead with a voice trembling with sorrow and fear, asking him not to be as he was, and to have pity on her. The wine-saturated breath engulfed her ever closer, and his face was right next to hers. It was no longer the old, good, and almost dear soul Vinicius, but a drunk, angry satyr who filled her with horror and disgust.
===
Full of anger and sudden surprise, Poppea's gaze began to shift from Caesar to Vinicius, and finally rested on Petronius.
===
Meanwhile, the slaves brought in three-legged bronze basins with ornate ram heads, filled with coals, onto which they began to sprinkle small sprigs of myrrh and spikenard.
===
— Enough. Go rest, my goddess.
===
— I believe! I believe! I believe!..
===
But Urban said:
===
Mijali teraz wzgórza Watykanu, które świeciły czerwono od pożaru, lecz za Naumachią skręcili w prawo, by po przebyciu pola Watykańskiego zbliżyć się do rzeki i, przeprawiwszy się przez nią, dotrzeć do Porta Flaminia. Nagle Chilo powstrzymał muła i rzekł:  
They were now passing the hills of the Vatican, which glowed red from the fire, but after the Naumachia, they turned right to approach the river after crossing the Vatican field and, having crossed it, reached the Porta Flaminia. Suddenly, Chilo stopped the mule and said:
===
— I desired her before, and now I desire her even more. When I held her hand, fire enveloped me... I must have her. If I were Zeus, I would surround her with a cloud, just as he surrounded Io, or I would fall upon her in a shower like he did on Danaë. I would like to kiss her lips until it hurts! I would like to hear her scream in my arms. I would like to kill Aulus and Pomponia, and abduct her and carry her in my arms to my home. I will not sleep tonight. I will order one of the slaves to be exercised, and I will listen to his groans...

— He lost it to his own pride. Everyone suspected him, no one really knew, but he himself couldn't hold it in and spread the news in secret to every corner. Have you heard the story of Ruffinus?
===
— Are there many of them? — asked Viniciusz.
===
— There are plenty of them like that — he said — that they could ignite a civil war, and remember, there were fears that they might not want to defend themselves. And they are dying like sheep.
===
— Yes! — said Viniciusz.
===
Vinicius was struck by these words and, returning to himself, began to ponder that perhaps indeed this kindness and mercy of Christians proves the infirmity of their souls. It seemed to him that people of strength and resilience could not forgive so easily. It occurred to him that this could indeed be the reason for the aversion that his Roman soul felt towards this teaching. "We know how to live and die!" said Petronius. And they? They can only forgive, but they do not understand true love or true hatred.
===
— Scratch myself. If you scratch your own pimples, you will destroy what is best in you.
===
And you were less sensitive than a stone,
===
— Lord, why did you command me to come here and establish your throne in this nest of the Beast?
===
Thinking about it, Petronius felt immensely tired. Is it worth living, and living in the uncertainty of tomorrow just to look at a similar order of the world? The genius of death is no less beautiful than the genius of sleep, and it also has wings on its arms.
===
— Oh Lyga? — exclaimed Pomponia in astonishment.
===
— Sir — said the Greek — here is what has come to my mind: do Christians have any signs, any "tesserae," without which no one will be admitted to the Ostrianum? I know that this is the case in places of worship and that I received such a tessera from Euricius; allow me then to go to him, sir, to inquire thoroughly and to procure those signs, if they turn out to be necessary.
===
Petronius laid his hand on his shoulder:
===
Above the city, the last quiet thunderclaps of the storm.

===
The steward of the atrium disappeared behind the curtain, but the awakening must not have gone easily, for Vinicius waited a long time and was starting to get impatient when at last the slaves brought in Chilon, and at a given signal, they immediately stepped back.
===
Having said this, he went to the library and, sitting down at a table made of pink marble, began to work on his "Satyricon".
===
Vinicius was delighted to hear those words, and replied:
===
— Good. Let this man wait tomorrow in my house for the arrival of the tribune, whom you will ask on my behalf to visit me in the morning.
===
And she raised her calm, blue eyes, like the sky, towards him, and began to shake her head in denial.
===
— Not yet, but Paul from Tarsus is coming with me to explain to me the teachings of Christ, and then I will receive baptism, because what you said, that they are enemies of life and joy, is not true!
===
— Yes, father.
===
Then Petronius began to laugh, and then he said further:
===
— The Sixth Praetorian Cohort — Vinicius replied.
===
— Therefore, so that if Tigellinus ever tells me: "Scevinus was with you," I could respond to him: "He was also with you that same day."
===
— Never having been a slave, she could not be freed.
===
A murmur rose throughout the amphitheater:
===
— Happy is he who, like me, has found love in such a closed form... Sometimes it seems to me that we are two gods... Just look: did Praxiteles, or Miron, or Skopas, or Lysippus create lines more wonderful than these? Is there comparable marble on Paros or in Pentelikon, warm, pink, and enamored? There are people who kiss the edges of vases, but I prefer to seek pleasure where it can truly be found.
===
But evidently, in his iron-clad breast, there were some sparks of compassion for human suffering, for instead of striking the spear against the shield as a signal of alarm, he steered Vinicius aside and said to him:
===
Chilo made himself as flat against the wall as a piece of plaster.
===
Vinicius's face turned pale, like marble.
===
— I am with you.
===
— Yes, Lygio.
===
A moment of silence fell again, after which Petronius said:
===
And so, while some begged the gods for mercy, others blasphemed them in the face of this terrible disaster. Elders were seen turned towards the temple of Jupiter the Liberator, who, stretching out their hands, called out: "You are the savior, save your altar and your city!" However, despair was mainly directed against the old Roman gods, who, in the perception of the populace, were obliged to watch more carefully over the city. They proved powerless, so they were mocked. Meanwhile, it happened that when a group of Egyptian priests appeared on the via Asinaria, conducting the statue of Isis, which had been rescued from the temple located near Porta Caelimontana, the crowd rushed into their procession, hitched themselves to the cart, pulled it all the way to the Appian Gate, and, seizing the statue, placed it in the temple of Mars, simultaneously roughing up the priests of that deity who had dared to resist. In other places, Serapis, Baal, or Jehovah were called upon, whose followers, swarming out of alleys around Subura and from the other side of the Tiber, filled the fields lying under the walls with their shouting and calling. However, their cries had a tone of triumph, so when some of the inhabitants joined the chorus, praising "the Lord of the World," others, outraged by this joyful clamor, attempted to silence it with violence. Here and there, songs strange and solemn were heard sung by middle-aged men, elders, women, and children, whose meanings could not be grasped, but in which the words: "Behold, the judge is coming on the day of wrath and calamity" were repeated over and over again. Thus, a restless and sleepless human wave encircled the burning city like a tumultuous sea.

↑ Scripulum or scrupulum, a small gold coin equivalent to a third of a gold denarius, or aureus.
===
— Let's honor him with a hundred-fold — Petroniusz replied with a tone of impatience, but do not ask him to save her a second time... Do you remember how Aeolus received Odysseus when he returned to ask him again for a favorable cargo of winds? The gods do not like to be repeated.
===
Then she began to walk rapidly around the room and speak to herself as if in despair:
===
— Maybe yours don't hold any novelty charm for you — he said after a moment — but (and here he began to look successively at Iras and Eunice, and finally placed his hand on the hip of the golden-haired Greek girl) take a look at this charmer. A few days ago, the younger Fonteius Capiton offered me three lovely boys from Clazomenae for her, for surely Scopas could not have created a more beautiful body. I do not understand why I have remained indifferent to her until now; after all, the thought of Chryzotemis hasn't held me back! So I’ll give her to you; take her for yourself!
===
I silenced.
===
And once again they began to approach him. However, the end of the evening was less happy, for Caesar, at the moment when Petronius was bidding him farewell, suddenly asked with squinted eyes and a face both malicious and joyful:
