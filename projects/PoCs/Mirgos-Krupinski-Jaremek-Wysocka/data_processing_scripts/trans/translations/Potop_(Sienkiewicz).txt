But it was a vain joy. They had not taken a thousand steps yet when a howling suddenly rang out ahead of them and a gray Tatar moth emerged from the river, where it had been lurking until now.
===
— Mr. Szczebrzycki? — asked the starosta.
===
Kmicic had a great desire to open this last one, but he did not dare; however, having held it up to the light, he convinced himself that it contained clean paper inside. This discovery finally assured him that both the girl and the letters were to be taken away from him.
===
Therefore, there were also those, especially among the German gunners, who were convinced that Częstochowa would not defend itself.
===
— Even if they take Malbork, in the meantime we will capture Carolus Gustavus, let's see if they will not surrender the fortress for the king?
===
Suddenly he stood frozen.
===
— As you wish, Colonel! — replied the soldier.
===
— Prince.
===
— Jam Kowalski, and this is Mrs. Kowalska. Go to all the devils!!
===
Tsca
===
More and more anxious eyes turned toward Greater Poland, which could be the first to face the storm. Leszczyński, the governor of Łęczyca, and Naruszewicz, the Lithuanian field writer, departed on a diplomatic mission to Sweden; however, their departure, instead of calming the frightened, ignited an even greater unrest.
===
And the whole ride, having turned back, releases the horses beyond the last unit of the enemy. In Wołmontowicze, only the old men, women, children, and the "young lady" with her companion remain.
===
— He has summoned me for today.
===
— I say that nothing will come of it! — replied Zagłoba. — You young ones, you do not understand that as things stand now, our king, our dear homeland, our armies may lose fifty battles one after the other... and war will go on as before, the nobility will gather, along with all the lower classes... And if it doesn't succeed once, it will succeed a second time, until the enemy's strength dwindles. But if the Swedes lose just one major battle, then the devils will take them without salvation, and the elector along with them.
===
The next morning, Mr. Sapieha sent Anusia to Grodno, with Mr. Kotczyc. In Grodno, from which Chowański had long ago departed, resided the voivode's family.
===
— And what about you, Janie?
===
"Most illustrious Lord Starost, and to me, most gracious benefactor and benefactor!"
===
— How is that? — said Zagłoba.
===
— Wise lady! — he exclaimed — to what king does your love belong?
===
They rushed to look; some ran up with torches and began to shine them in the eyes of the corpses. After the first moment of astonishment, a buzz and commotion broke out. Those who had already laid down in the stables and barns flew in as well. The whole house shone with light, filled with people, and amidst this chaos, calls, and questions, only the beaten ones lay quietly and evenly against the wall, indifferent to everything and — against their nature — calm. Their souls had departed, and neither the trumpets of battle nor the clinking of cups at the feast could awaken their bodies.
===
"There is no faith among the Swedes (wrote Father Paszkowski), no religion. Nothing divine or human is sacred and inviolable for them; they are not accustomed to keeping anything secured by treaties or public promises."
===
— Radziwiłł is coming! I'm betting everything on your head, because Prince Jeremi said that you are a born leader. I will watch over things myself, but you advise and lead!
===
— I'm not giving an example. Hm! What would I do?… But Skrzetuski, who has a Roman soul, would not sustain him, and yet I am certain that God would not allow innocent blood to be spilled for that reason.
===
— Oh, indeed!
===
— But we arrived.
===
— Surely, it is not for me, for I am unworthy... But since I am substituting for the absent marshal, I have come to greet, to greet humbly!
===
— Is the Kiev castellan also now in Lublin?
===
— And what is the relative of the gentleman doing?
===
— My Butrymi, Domaszewicze are already here.
===
— No! not for consolation! — replied Kulwiec-Hippocentaurus — but once again for the health of Jędruś, our beloved captain! Onto, my lords, he embraced us here in Lubicz, us poor exiles, without a roof over our heads.
===
— I prefer to sit among enemies than among traitors! — Stankiewicz replied.
===
— Surely — said the king. — These have been hard times for those who understand military duty, but obedience must have its limits, beyond which guilt begins. Is there still strength among the elders at Radziwiłł?
===
"Mene — Tekel — Parsin"[1].
===
— Your Grace, — said Kmicic — often God forgives great sins for small mercy. None of us knows when we will have to stand before Christ's judgment...
===
— To a private person, not a member of parliament!…
===
Suddenly, Kmicic began to breathe as heavily as a man who is walking up a steep mountain.
===
— Those trenches are much further away... so I'm doing well! — he whispered to himself.
===
— The walls do not care for that. From the roofs, grenades roll down as if you were throwing loaves of bread. Magic! magic! — they repeated. — Nothing good awaits us here!
===
— Then to Opole! — shouted the king — and then on the road and whatever God gives!
===
There was no shortage of a bad example from above. Mr. Skoraszewski just reported from Czaplinek that the Swedes are not far away, when at the war council Mr. Zygmunt from Grudna Grudziński, the starost of Środa, was released to go home, which was strongly advocated by his uncle Andrzej, the voivode of Kalisz.
===
— It is four with the prince.
===
The watchmaster left, and they began to clink their glasses even more, although Kmicic pretended to drink more than he actually did. He did not like the wine, it did not go to his head, and it did not lift his spirits, while meanwhile the others were already getting tipsy.
===
— There is no other way! — said the chancellor
===
— Tfu! to hell with the devils! — exclaimed Mr. Rosiński, the subjudge — enough of the nonsense! I'm going!
===
— Oh ho! already in Silesia. The Swedes won't get us here!
===
Finally, he was caught under Gołąbiem, not far from the confluence of the Wieprz and the Vistula. Some Polish banners standing ready, launching themselves with force at the enemy, spread terror and confusion. Thus, Sir Wołodyjowski jumped forward with his Laudan banner and supported the Danish Prince Waldemar; meanwhile, Sir Kawecki Samuel and the younger Jan charged down the hill with the armored banner against the hired Englishmen of Wikilson — and in the blink of an eye, they devoured them, like a pike consumes a chub, while Sir Malawski engaged the Biponic prince so tightly that men and horses got mixed together like the dust a whirlwind stirs up when two winds from opposite sides collide. In an instant, the Swedes were pushed back toward the Vistula, which prompted Duglas to hasten with his elite cavalry to their aid. However, the momentum and these new reinforcements could not be stopped; thus, the Swedes began to leap from the high bank onto the ice, falling dead so thickly that they darkened the snowy field like letters on a white sheet of paper. Prince Waldemar fell, Wikilson fell, and the Biponic prince, unseated from his horse, broke his leg — yet both Sir Kawecki and Sir Malawski, as well as Rudawski, Rogowski, Sir Tymiński, Choiński, and Porwaniecki all fell as well; only Sir Wołodyjowski, although he submerged himself into the Swedish ranks like a diver into water, sustained not a single wound.
===
— How so?
===
— Sir knight, — she said — so many rumors are circulating in Taurogos that we are wandering in them as if in a forest. Some say that the prince vojvoda died of his own death; others say he was slain by sabers. What is the cause of his death?
===
The guard, standing on the edge, presented a weapon. Mr. Zagłoba completely calmed down, soon taking on a countenance befitting the dignity of a delegate and said in Latin:
===
This is how Mr. Zagłoba reasoned with himself. Meanwhile, one hour and then another had passed, and at last it began to dawn. Gray streaks of light coming through the bars slowly dispersed the darkness prevailing in the cellar and revealed the gloomy knightly figures sitting against the walls. Wołodyjowski and the two Skrzetuscy dozed off from exhaustion, but as it became brighter, sounds of soldiers' footsteps, the clinking of weapons, the pounding of hooves, and the sound of trumpets reached them from the castle courtyard. The knights sprang to their feet.
===
— Nothing at all! — said Ganchoff. — You’ll see some fascinating things and even the face of the Swedish king, who is a warrior, the greatest in the world after our prince.
===
— And did the lists come through? — asked Kmicic.
===
The turmoil and confusion lasted long until the Swedish general extracted the truth from the chaos of testimonies, that the cannon had been deliberately blown up by someone. Immediate searches were ordered. As a result, in the morning, the searching soldiers discovered Mr. Kmicic lying in a ditch.
===
— Mr. Lubomirski is attacking from Podgórze with the army and the highlanders! — it was said the next day.
===
Lady Alexandra was silent.
===
You won't conquer me!
===
CHAPTER XII.
===
And he touched with a burning torch the side of Kmita, after which he said:
===
— I drank so much water from the Pilica that soon I'll be looking to see how fish are hatching in my belly, but it's better than water.
===
The chase continued. The Swedish horses had less and less breath in their chests and were rearing more and more often. Out of the thousand brightest cavalrymen who had emerged near Kanneberg, only a little over a hundred riders remained, while the rest lay in a long strip along the forest road. But even this last group was decreasing every moment, as Polish hands did not stop working over them.
===
— And you! — added Kmicic, pulling a cord from his pocket.
===
Oleńka now finally noticed Miss Kulwiec, lying on the sofa.
===
— And I am under Mr. Koniecpolski, the father of today’s ensign. We have struck Gustaw Adolf hard several times in Prussia and captured quite a few prisoners; I became thoroughly acquainted with them and all their ways. Our boys were quite amazed by them because you must know that the Swedes, being a nation that constantly wades in water and draws the greatest gains from the sea, are exquisitely skilled divers. So we made them show off, and what do you think of that: you throw a rascal into one hole in the ice, and he pops out in another and even holds a live herring in his mouth...
===
— Let's get out of here, Mr. Michal, those traitors are ready to shoot!
===
— Oh wait, let me ask! — said Kokosiński.
===
Suddenly a scream arose so great that the feasting guests in the room fell silent.
===
— Let's go — Sadowski repeated. — To tell the truth, I should have ordered you to put bags over your heads, as is the custom, but we have nothing to hide here, and since you were looking at the ramparts, it's better for us.
===
— I would have them hanged, for as bandits they attacked an innocent village and cut down people... But Jan says that this cannot be done.
===
— And you know, gentlemen, where that Kmicic came to my mind? Here is Babinicz, the royal courier, he is greatly similar to him. I myself was mistaken at first.
===
— For the opening of the fortress gates, His Royal Majesty (here he again listed titles at length) offers Your Grace the Province of Lublin in hereditary possession!
===
— Do you really think that the mace is in the wrong hands?
===
But Jan Skrzetuski, who was overseeing the overall course of the battle and leading the banner at the forefront, did not follow the example of the Swedish captain; instead, he charged forward with full force in a compact column, which, having encountered a weakened Swedish line, broke through it in the blink of an eye as if it were a wedge and turned with momentum towards the church, to the right side, taking the rear of one half of the Swedes, while Mirski and Stankiewicz jumped in from the reserve, having underneath them part of the Laudans and all of Kowalski's dragoons.
===
Suddenly, one of the soldiers stepped out of the line and handed over a tin can.
===
— Come here closer, big guy!
===
— Your grace, I see this not only in war, but you can also hold the primacy in counsel — said Mr. Stanisław.
===
— I have not yet lost the kingdom, as long as I have such a queen!… Let her will be done, for she spoke in prophetic inspiration. The sooner I depart and stand inter regna, the better it will be!…
===
The dragons surrounded the wagon in a circle. Mr. Wołodyjowski had a flame in his eyes.
===
The priest turned to the bench and blessed Mr. Andrzej, who, still leaning against the wall, resembled the dead more than the living, as his soul had departed from him in happiness and soared towards the heavens.
===
And again later:
===
So he quickly went home and began to dress. He put on high riding boots, yellow, with flaps on the tops and gilded spurs, and a new red uniform; in addition, a rapier in a steel sheath, front-facing, with a hilt adorned with gold; furthermore, a half-breastplate of bright steel covering only the upper part of his chest up to the neck; he also had a lynx cap with a beautiful heron feather, but since this only matched Polish attire, he left it in the chest and put on a Swedish helmet with a crest, and stepped out onto the porch.
===
— Jeno never try to betray me! — he said menacingly — for you will not endure it, and the hand of God alone will be able to save you then!
===
— I will go to see! — he said.
===
— Janie! — he said — what if we send a handful of people to Wołodyjowski?
===
Having said this, the prince began to look more closely and with a certain fondness at Mr. Andrzej, for from what he had heard about him, he considered him to be a man of his own kind.
===
— Wuj, that's wuj.
===
Meanwhile, the master-glassmaker brought two goblets made of Venetian crystal, crafted so wonderfully that they could be considered the eighth wonder of the world. The crystal, intricately carved and polished perhaps for years, emitted truly diamond-like glints; the setting was worked on by Italian masters. The bases were made of gold, sculpted into small figures depicting the victorious leader's entrance into the Capitol. Thus the leader rode in a golden chariot, on a road paved with pearls. Behind him followed the captives with their hands bound; a king of sorts in a turban made of a single emerald, followed by legionnaires bearing insignias and eagles. Over fifty figurines were contained on each base, tiny, the size of a hazelnut, yet crafted so exquisitely that you could discern the features and emotions of each, the pride of the victors and the humiliation of the vanquished. Golden filigrees connected the base to the cup, like fine hair, twisted into the shape of vine leaves, bunches of grapes, and various flowers. These filigrees wound around the crystal, merging at the top into a single circle, forming the rim of the goblet, set with stones of seven colors.
===
At first, Müller couldn't comprehend why, when the entire country had surrendered, one place was still holding out, what force was sustaining it, in the name of what hopes those monks refused to succumb, what they were striving for, what they expected?
===
But Mr. Wołodyjowski meanwhile stepped out of the room, evidently wanting to see for himself the extent of the disaster and to observe the people; so Rzędzian said:
===
To Mirski:
===
Radziwiłł got up, hurriedly made his way to the kneeler, and tearing the crucifix from it, began to speak in a vehement, muted voice:
===
He lay still for a while, then opened his eyes. At that moment, one of the soldiers poured some liquor into his mouth, while others lifted him under the arms.
===
— But you are too quick to judge and you cast shame upon the entire nation, in which, as that same Babinicz said, there has not yet been anyone who would raise his hand against his own king.… Let it not surprise you that after such abandonment, after such a break of the oath and faith, which both of us experienced with the gracious king, I still say that no one would dare commit such a dreadful act, even among those who still serve the Swedes today.
===
After an easy and unexpected conquest, the shrewd warrior quickly realized that the Swedish lion had devoured more than his insides could bear. Upon the return of Jan Kazimierz, he lost hope of maintaining the Commonwealth, but renouncing in his soul the entirety, he wanted at least to retain as much of the gains as possible, especially Royal Prussia, a province adjacent to his Pomerania, fertile, sprinkled with great cities, and rich.
===
— The servant of your grace.
===
— I prefer the Swedes to such a hassle! Sir! Sir! when will you put an end to this Commonwealth, and give old Zagłoba a warm hearth and mulled beer… even if without cream… Knock, old man, on your nag, knock, until you can’t knock anymore before death… Is there any snuff around? Maybe I’ll sneeze away this drowsiness... The moon shines right in my face, peering down to my belly, and I don’t know what it’s looking for, because it will find nothing. Such a war is a dog’s life, I repeat!
===
— Know that I have the evidence in hand, black on white, that this was revenge for Kmicic's conversion.
===
— Stachowicz is not here. Your Grace ordered him to be shot in Kiejdany.
===
— And then, gentlemen — the voivode added — we will ride back to our homes and, with God's help, we will begin the harvest with the thought that we have saved our homeland today.
===
— I heard in Kruszyn — he said — that Lisola asked: “And will you shake the treasure for the monks?” — to which Wrzeszczowicz, he who stands by the walls, replied: “The Holy Mother does not need thalers in the prior’s chest.” Today that very same Wrzeszczowicz writes to you, venerable fathers, that he will bear the costs himself and will even add to your wealth. Consider his sincerity!
===
— The lady.
