Once so valiant, today a pale knight.

Wears the same bark that I once grew,
===
What to reply to the lady...
===
For a raspberry jug, sister?... If from the pine
===
For the hermit, completely hidden by trees
===
What? Are you threatening me when I am sick?
===
200 Mrs. Grabek! Grabietko, may Grabiec remember
===
Here is raspberry
===
So that each white breast sheds a tear.
===
In the streams, the water chases after water.
===
Enough!...
===
WIDOW.
===
Maybe he found out...
===
Read like before.
===
WDOWA.
===
GOPLANA.
===
Why am I let in here?
===
(the servant leaves.)
===
Play! I will follow.
===
In a dream, snakes; may they bite forever,
===
The place where you have to strike. — Oh! lightning
===
(Grabiec bursts onto the stage, followed by a crowd of children.)
===
230 I don't want advice
===
GRABIEC.
===
WOŹNI.
===
Either a horrible novel to be dribbled with words
===
FIRST OF THE GENTLEMEN.
===
Such ruthlessness! to exile an old mother,
===
GOPLANA.
===
BALLADYNA.
===
How many types of beggars
===
Be vigilant over the sleepy,
===
And I need support. — Look, the poor thing is fainting.

KANCLERZ.

SCENE ONE.
===
150 To the opened iron capital.

ALINA.

50 Swallows lie still.

Before the giant figure of Kirkor and shouted:
===
I am not poor — Grey, grey, grey
===
Do you play the lute?
===
The jug, and here is the knife — And those raspberries
===
GRABIEC.
===
Set out. —
===
CHOCHLIK.
===
WDOWA and KIRKOR are sitting on the bench.
===
So one — to be the husband of the other;
===
235 A wasp saw on the flowers of the fallow land,
===
BALLADYNA.
===
If I am not Mrs. Kirkorowa,

And if you return from the grave, you will tell.
===
I will order the hell's sorcery.
===
Balladyna?
===
SCENE ONE.
===
So now every evening to the forest clearings
===
You drunk!....
===
Let all hearts on the bell tower be commanded.
===
GRABIEC.
===
In the eyes of the Countess? A simple song
===
I hear crying voices...
===
SCENE TWO.
===
GRABIEC.
===
Flowers grew from the sown hope.
===
What is it, daughter?
===
And a wreath of flowers will spread such a fragrance,
===
ALINA.
===
40 And sleep, let Goplana come now.
===
GRABIEC (whom everyone is looking at.)
===
I had the knife ready...
===
What flies without wind?
===
I support the flowers buildings
===
A dark tomb for a thousand people
===
In both, there is simplicity and tenderness,
===
The Revenge of the Powerful Lord. — Or maybe — if
===
35 Bogdaj learned about pestilence and famine!
===
I think, as I think...
===
It will be spots of scarlet.
===
SKIERKA.
===
What was wrong with me?... How awful I was...
===
Daughter; not mine! not mine! not mine!
===
(to Kostryna)
===
WDOWA.
===
Queen of the Wave Goplana.
===
I will go... and I will bless the hunt, may they perish.
===
PUSTELNIK.
===
I can already read victory on your forehead.
===
Pali... huh?...
===
KIRKOR.
===
65 I know — But why
===
Do you love me?
===
No, sir.
===
(Kirkor is leaving.)
===
Not from the poppies. My head is not for the sign...
===
Let not vanity lead you into gold.
===
I am with the Angel — you are the Angel over me.
===
What rises from the grave in the cemetery.
===
I lived in purple, today I wear rags;
===
Sister...
