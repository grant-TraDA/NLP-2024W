Here's a breakdown of how I interpreted the review:

* The product category is ""Others"" because the review doesn't explicitly mention a specific category like ""Electric bicycle"" or ""Refrigerator"".
* The product attributes are the words ""great"", ""okay"" because they describe the product's qualities.
* The other keywords are the words ""bike"", ""works"", ""electric"", and ""refrigerator"" because they're related to the product but not explicitly attributes.
